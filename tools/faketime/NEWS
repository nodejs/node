Since 0.9.6:
    - Julien Gilli added an option to disable monotonic time faking
    - Azat Khuzhin added support for COARSE clocks

Since 0.9.5:
    - fixed crashes that happened when other LD_PRELOAD libraries were used
    - fixed passing through of return values when using the faketime wrapper
    - fixed compile-time issues with CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW on some platforms
    - rbalint added Filter commands: FAKETIME_ONLY_CMDS and
      FAKETIME_SKIP_CMDS control which (sub-)processes libfaketime
      is applied to.

Since 0.9:
    - ryandesign at MacPorts provided a Portfile for MacPorts and
      fixed various build issues on OSX.
    - Balint Reczey added support for nanosecond resolution, saving
      timestamps to files, speeding up and slowing down per-process
      timers, CLOCK_MONOTONIC and CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW, faketime
      support for system calls such as sleep() and alarm().
    - Applied a patch by Gerardo Malazdrewicz and Toni G to restore
      compatibility with newer versions of glibc.
    - Balint Reczey added an option to use the same global clock setting
      for all libfaketime-spawned processes.
    - Balint Reczey has rewritten the faketime wrapper shell script in C
      and refactored libfaketime.
    - Balint Reczey added support for advancing the time with each time-
      related system call ("deterministic time").
    - Added "timeprivacy" wrapper by adrelanos; it ensures that programs
      are started with unique timestamps.
    - Code and documentation cleanup by Tomi Ollila.
    - Reworked Makefiles for more flexible installation, including fixes
      by Lukas Fleischner, Daniel Kahm Gillmor, and Hugues Andreux.
    - Fixed license issues as pointed out by Paul Wouters.
    - Mac OS X support has been improved for OS X 10.7 and 10.8; due to
      changes to the underlying libraries on OS X, libfaketime 0.9.5 will
      no longer work with OS X < 10.6; use libfaketime 0.9(.1) for older
      OS X installations.
    - Don Fong has contributed a new framework for functional tests.
      Petr Salinger ensured its compatibility with GNU/kFreeBSD.

Since 0.8.2:
    - Added support for "limited faking".
      You can optionally specify when libfaketime starts to fake the
      returned timestamps and when it shall stop doing so. For example,
      a program can be started regularly, and after 5 minutes run-time
      it will be sent two years into the future. Those limiting
      start and stop times can be specified in seconds or as the
      number of any time-related function calls within the program.
    - Added a feature to spawn an external process after x seconds
      or y time-related system calls. This can, for example, be used
      to execute an arbitrary shell script x seconds after a program
      has been started.

Since 0.8.1:
    - Added a MacOS port.
      Thanks to Derrick Brashear!
    - Added a functional test framework that aids in automatically
      determining whether libfaketime works properly on the current
      machine. Thanks to Don Fong!

Since 0.8:
    - Changed directory layout and Makefile structure.
      Thanks to Lukas Fleischer!

Since 0.7:
    - Added support for fstatat() and fstatat64() which were introduced in
      Linux kernel 2.6.16 and used in recent coreutils.
      Thanks to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for the report!
      This can be disabled by passing -DNO_ATFILE in the Makefile.
    - Added a simple wrapper shell script and a man page for it. Makes it
      easier to run commands under faked system times. It assumes that the
      libraries will be copied to /usr/lib/faketime during installation,
      please adjust this path if necessary. The "install" target in the
      Makefile has been adapted accordingly.
    - Added support for fractional time offsets, such as FAKETIME="+1,5h".
      Please note that either , or . has to be used as a delimiter
      depending on your locale. Thanks to Karl Chen!
    - Added support for speeding the clock up or slowing it down. For
      example, FAKETIME="+5d x2,0" will set the faked time 5 days into
      the future and make the clock run twice as fast for the specified
      program. Slowing it down can be done e.g. by using FAKETIME="+0 x0,5".
      Again, the delimiter to use for the fraction depends on your locale.
      Thanks to Karl Chen!

Since 0.6:
    Main version 0.7 contributions by David North, TDI:
    - Added ability to 'start clock at' a specific time.
    - Added pthread synchronization support
    - Added a 2 second delay to timetest.c so one can observe if the
      clock is relative or absolute
    - Added test.sh example of 'start clock at'
    - Added ability to disable the FAKE_STAT functionality at library-start
      in the case that the library was compiled -DFAKE_STAT, and added another
      test case for demonstrating this
    - Repaired a bug w.r.t. strptime/mktime wherein 'isdst' was uninitialized
      which led to pseudorandom +/- 1 hour results being returned in 'start at'
      or absolute time modes

    Other enhancements:
    - Fixed missing interceptions to libc-internal functions and added notes
      about a workaround for running Java programs with faked times in the
      future (they worked properly, but often locked up at exiting). Thanks to
      Jamie Cameron of Google for in-depth analysis and prototype solution!

Since 0.5:
    - Performance enhancements by means of caching the data read
      e.g. from $HOME/.faketimerc for 10 seconds.
    - Several file timestamp related system calls such as fstat() will be
      intercepted now. See the README file on how to turn this off if you
      do not need it. Thanks to Philipp Hachtmann!
    - A system-wide /etc/faketimerc file will now be used if no FAKETIME
      environment variable has been set and no $HOME/.faketimerc is present.
      Thanks to David Burley, Jacob Moorman, and Wayne Davison of
      SourceForge, Inc.!
    - Added trivial Makefile targets clean/distclean/install
    - Changed Makefile target test to run new test.sh script
    - Added new test cases to timetest.c

Since 0.4:
    - Allow "y" for years of offset specification. Thanks to Bas ten Berge!

Since 0.3:
    - Support for FAKETIME_FMT environment variable. Thanks to Moreno Baricevic!

Since 0.2:
    - Intercept clock_gettime(). Thanks to Andreas Thienemann!

Since 0.1:
    - Fixed segfault when calling time(NULL). Thanks to Andres Ojamaa!
    - Added additional sanity checks.
