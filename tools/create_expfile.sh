# Writes out all of the exported symbols to a file.
# This is needed on AIX as symbols are not exported
# by an executable by default and need to be listed
# specifically for export so that they can be used
# by native add-ons.
#
# The raw symbol data is obtained by using nm on
# the .a files which make up the node executable.
#
# -Xany processes symbols for both 32-bit and
# 64-bit (the default is for 32-bit only).
#
# -g selects only exported symbols.
#
# -C, -B and -p ensure that the output is in a
# format that can be easily parsed and converted
# into the required symbol.
#
# -C suppresses the demangling of C++ names.
# -B writes the output in BSD format.
# -p displays the info in a standard portable
#    output format.
#
# Only include symbols if they are of the following
# types and don't start with a dot.
#
# T - Global text symbol.
# D - Global data symbol.
# B - Global bss symbol.
#
# The final sort allows removal of any duplicates.
#
# Symbols for the gtest libraries are excluded as
# they are not linked into the node executable.
