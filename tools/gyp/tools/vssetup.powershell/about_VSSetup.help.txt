SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Enumerate and select instances of Visual Studio.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    Visual Studio 2017 introduced a new setup engine capable of installing
    multiple instances of Visual Studio and other products in the Visual Studio
    family. This module provides commands to enumerate those instances and
    select instances that meet your criteria. For example, in a development
    environment you might have a script that finds an instance of Visual Studio
    with the the Managed Desktop workload for writing projects targeting the
    .NET Framework. See below for more examples.

VARIABLES
    You can get the version of this module or of the query API the module uses
    from the `$VSSetupVersionTable` variable.

    PS> $VSSetupVersionTable
    
    Name                           Value
    ----                           -----
    QueryVersion                   1.15.23.19330
    ModuleVersion                  2.1.2.4917

EXAMPLES
    You can enumerate all instances - even those with errors that require a
    repair - with the following command.

    Get-VSSetupInstance -All

    If you want to select all launchable instances of Visual Studio products
    that have the Managed Desktop workload, use the following command.

    Get-VSSetupInstance | Get-VSSetupInstance `
        -Require 'Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktop'

    You can also get the instance for an installation directory if you want to
    discover more about what is installed to that directory.

    Get-VSSetupInstance 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Community'
