wrk - a HTTP benchmarking tool

  wrk is a modern HTTP benchmarking tool capable of generating significant
  load when run on a single multi-core CPU. It combines a multithreaded
  design with scalable event notification systems such as epoll and kqueue.

Basic Usage

  wrk -t8 -c400 -r10m http://localhost:8080/index.html

  This runs wrk with 8 threads, keeping 400 connections open, and making a
  total of 10 million HTTP GET requests to http://localhost:8080/index.html

  Output:

  Making 10000000 requests to http://localhost:8080/index.html
    8 threads and 400 connections

  Requests/sec: 503396.23
  Transfer/sec:    176.16MB

Benchmarking Tips

  The machine running wrk must have a sufficient number of ephemeral ports
  available and closed sockets should be recycled quickly. To handle the
  initial connection burst the server's listen(2) backlog should be greater
  than the number of concurrent connections being tested.

Acknowledgements

  wrk contains code from a number of open source projects including the
  'ae' event loop from redis, the nginx/joyent/node.js 'http-parser' and
  the Tiny Mersenne Twister PRNG. Please consult the NOTICE file for
