 *
 * Queue Scheduler
 *
 * <span class="informal">Put every next task on a queue, instead of executing it immediately</span>
 *
 * `queue` scheduler, when used with delay, behaves the same as {@link async} scheduler.
 *
 * When used without delay, it schedules given task synchronously - executes it right when
 * it is scheduled. However when called recursively, that is when inside the scheduled task,
 * another task is scheduled with queue scheduler, instead of executing immediately as well,
 * that task will be put on a queue and wait for current one to finish.
 *
 * This means that when you execute task with `queue` scheduler, you are sure it will end
 * before any other task scheduled with that scheduler will start.
 *
 * @examples <caption>Schedule recursively first, then do something</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => {
 *   Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => console.log('second')); // will not happen now, but will be put on a queue
 *
 *   console.log('first');
 * });
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "first"
 * // "second"
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Reschedule itself recursively</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(function(state) {
 *   if (state !== 0) {
 *     console.log('before', state);
 *     this.schedule(state - 1); // `this` references currently executing Action,
 *                               // which we reschedule with new state
 *     console.log('after', state);
 *   }
 * }, 0, 3);
 *
 * // In scheduler that runs recursively, you would expect:
 * // "before", 3
 * // "before", 2
 * // "before", 1
 * // "after", 1
 * // "after", 2
 * // "after", 3
 *
 * // But with queue it logs:
 * // "before", 3
 * // "after", 3
 * // "before", 2
 * // "after", 2
 * // "before", 1
 * // "after", 1
 *
