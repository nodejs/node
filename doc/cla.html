and your help in improving the project, so we want you to
understand what will be done with the Contributions.  This
license is for your protection as well as the protection of

Contributions and send us an original signed Agreement at

<h3>Corporate Contributions:</h3>

<p>
If you are employed as a software engineer, or if your
employer is in the business of developing software, or
otherwise may claim rights in the Contributions, please
provide information about your employer's policy on
contributing to open source projects, including the name of
the supervisor to contact in connection with such

<h3>You and NodeJS agree:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
You grant us the ability to use the Contributions in any
way.  You hereby grant to NodeJS, a non-exclusive,
irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicenseable,
transferable license under all of Your relevant intellectual
property rights (including copyright, patent, and any other
rights), to use, copy, prepare derivative works of,
distribute and publicly perform and display the
Contributions on any licensing terms, including without
limitation: (a) open source licenses like the GNU General
Public License (GPL), the GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL), the Common Public License, or the Berkeley Software
Distribution license (BSD); and (b) binary, proprietary, or
commercial licenses.  Except for the licenses granted
herein, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to
the Contribution.

<li>
You are able to grant us these rights.  You represent
that You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
If Your employer has rights to intellectual property that
You create, You represent that You have received permission
to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or
that Your employer has waived such rights for the
Contributions.

<li>
The Contributions are your original work.  You represent
that the Contributions are Your original works of
authorship, and to Your knowledge, no other person claims,
or has the right to claim, any right in any invention or
patent related to the Contributions.  You also represent
that You are not legally obligated, whether by entering into
an agreement or otherwise, in any way that conflicts with
the terms of this license.  For example, if you have signed
an agreement requiring you to assign the intellectual
property rights in the Contributions to an employer or
customer, that would conflict with the terms of this
license.

<li>
We determine the code that is in our project.  You
understand that the decision to include the Contribution in
any project or source repository is entirely that of NodeJS,
and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contributions
will be included in any product.

<li>
No Implied Warranties.  NodeJS acknowledges that, except
as explicitly described in this Agreement, the Contribution
is provided on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT   LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR
CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
