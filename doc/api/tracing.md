# Tracing

Trace Event provides a mechanism to centralize tracing information generated by
V8, Node core, and userspace code.

Tracing can be enabled by passing the `--trace-events-enabled` flag when starting a
Node.js application.

The set of categories for which traces are recorded can be specified using the
`--trace-event-categories` flag followed by a list of comma separated category names.
By default the `node` and `v8` categories are enabled.

```txt
node --trace-events-enabled --trace-event-categories v8,node server.js
```

Running Node.js with tracing enabled will produce log files that can be opened
in the [`chrome://tracing`](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool)
tab of Chrome.
