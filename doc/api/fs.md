The `node:fs` module enables interacting with the file system in a
way modeled on standard POSIX functions.

<!-- NOTE: This file includes improvements to fs.StatFs documentation as per issue #50749 -->

To use the promise-based APIs:

```mjs
import * as fs from 'node:fs/promises';
```

```cjs
const fs = require('node:fs/promises');
```

To use the callback and sync APIs:

```mjs
import * as fs from 'node:fs';
```

```cjs
const fs = require('node:fs');
```

All file system operations have synchronous, callback, and promise-based
forms, and are accessible using both CommonJS syntax and ES6 Modules (ESM).

## Promise example

Promise-based operations return a promise that is fulfilled when the
asynchronous operation is complete.
