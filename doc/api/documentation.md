# About this documentation

<!--introduced_in=v0.10.0-->

<!-- type=misc -->

Welcome to the official API reference documentation for Node.js!

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on the [V8 JavaScript engine][].

## Stability index

<!--type=misc-->

Throughout the documentation are indications of a section's stability. Some APIs
are so proven and so relied upon that they are unlikely to ever change at all.
Others are brand new and experimental, or known to be hazardous.

The stability indexes are as follows:

> Stability: 0 - Deprecated. The feature may emit warnings. Backward
> compatibility is not guaranteed.

<!-- separator -->

> Stability: 1 - Experimental. The feature is not subject to
> [semantic versioning][] rules. Non-backward compatible changes or removal may
> occur in any future release. Use of the feature is not recommended in
> production environments.
>
> Experimental features are subdivided into stages:
>
> * 1.0 - Early development. Experimental features at this stage are unfinished
>   and subject to substantial change. APIs may be incomplete, inconsistent, or have
>   significant breaking changes between releases.
> * 1.1 - Active development. Experimental features at this stage are nearing
>   minimum viability. The core functionality is implemented but may still undergo
>   refinement. Some breaking changes could still occur.
> * 1.2 - Release candidate. Experimental features at this stage are hopefully
>   ready to become stable. No further breaking changes are anticipated but may
>   still occur in response to user feedback or the features' underlying
>   specification development. We encourage user testing and feedback so that
>   we can know that this feature is ready to be marked as stable.
>
> Experimental features leave the experimental status typically either by
> graduating to stable, or are removed without a deprecation cycle.

<!-- separator -->

> Stability: 2 - Stable. Compatibility with the npm ecosystem is a high
> priority.

<!-- separator -->

> Stability: 3 - Legacy. Although this feature is unlikely to be removed and is
> still covered by semantic versioning guarantees, it is no longer actively
> maintained, and other alternatives are available.

Features are marked as legacy rather than being deprecated if their use does no
harm, and they are widely relied upon within the npm ecosystem. Bugs found in
legacy features are unlikely to be fixed.

Use caution when making use of Experimental features, particularly when
authoring libraries. Users may not be aware that experimental features are being
used. Bugs or behavior changes may surprise users when Experimental API
modifications occur. To avoid surprises, use of an Experimental feature may need
a command-line flag. Experimental features may also emit a [warning][].

## Stability overview

<!-- STABILITY_OVERVIEW_SLOT_BEGIN -->
API stability is a measure of how likely it is that a given feature might change in the future. Each API is labeled with a stability index that indicates its current status. You can find stability information:

1. At the top of each API documentation page
2. Within individual method and class descriptions
3. In tables listing API properties and methods

Pay close attention to "Stability: 0 - Deprecated" and "Stability: 1 - Experimental" labels when building production applications. For production environments:

* Avoid using deprecated APIs as they will be removed in future versions
* Use experimental APIs with caution and have contingency plans for breaking changes
* Prefer stable APIs (Stability: 2) for critical application components
* Consider providing feedback on experimental APIs to help improve them

The stability index helps you make informed decisions about which Node.js features to depend on in your projects.

## JSON output

<!-- YAML
added: v0.6.12
-->

Every `.html` document has a corresponding `.json` document. This is for IDEs
and other utilities that consume the documentation. The JSON format contains the same 
information as the HTML documentation but structured in a machine-readable format that 
enables:

* Automated documentation tooling
* Integration with code editors for inline documentation
* Third-party documentation viewers and search tools
* Custom documentation processing pipelines

The JSON files are generated automatically during the documentation build process.

## System calls and man pages

Node.js functions which wrap a system call will document that. The docs link
to the corresponding man pages which describe how the system call works.

Most Unix system calls have Windows analogues. Still, behavior differences may
be unavoidable.
