# Performance measurement APIs

<!--introduced_in=v8.5.0-->

> Stability: 2 - Stable

<!-- source_link=lib/perf_hooks.js -->

This module provides an implementation of a subset of the W3C
[Web Performance APIs][] as well as additional APIs for
Node.js-specific performance measurements.

Node.js supports the following [Web Performance APIs][]:

* [High Resolution Time][]
* [Performance Timeline][]
* [User Timing][]
* [Resource Timing][]

```js
const { PerformanceObserver, performance } = require('node:perf_hooks');

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  console.log(items.getEntries()[0].duration);
  performance.clearMarks();
});
obs.observe({ type: 'measure' });
performance.measure('Start to Now');

performance.mark('A');
doSomeLongRunningProcess(() => {
  performance.measure('A to Now', 'A');

  performance.mark('B');
  performance.measure('A to B', 'A', 'B');
});
```

## `perf_hooks.performance`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

An object that can be used to collect performance metrics from the current
Node.js instance. It is similar to [`window.performance`][] in browsers.

### `performance.clearMarks([name])`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

* `name` {string}

If `name` is not provided, removes all `PerformanceMark` objects from the
Performance Timeline. If `name` is provided, removes only the named mark.

### `performance.clearMeasures([name])`

<!-- YAML
added: v16.7.0
-->

* `name` {string}

If `name` is not provided, removes all `PerformanceMeasure` objects from the
Performance Timeline. If `name` is provided, removes only the named measure.

### `performance.clearResourceTimings([name])`

<!-- YAML
added: v18.2.0
-->

* `name` {string}

If `name` is not provided, removes all `PerformanceResourceTiming` objects from
the Resource Timeline. If `name` is provided, removes only the named resource.

### `performance.eventLoopUtilization([utilization1[, utilization2]])`

<!-- YAML
added:
 - v14.10.0
 - v12.19.0
-->

* `utilization1` {Object} The result of a previous call to
  `eventLoopUtilization()`.
* `utilization2` {Object} The result of a previous call to
  `eventLoopUtilization()` prior to `utilization1`.
* Returns {Object}
  * `idle` {number}
  * `active` {number}
  * `utilization` {number}

The `eventLoopUtilization()` method returns an object that contains the
cumulative duration of time the event loop has been both idle and active as a
high resolution milliseconds timer. The `utilization` value is the calculated
Event Loop Utilization (ELU).

If bootstrapping has not yet finished on the main thread the properties have
the value of `0`. The ELU is immediately available on [Worker threads][] since
bootstrap happens within the event loop.

Both `utilization1` and `utilization2` are optional parameters.

If `utilization1` is passed, then the delta between the current call's `active`
and `idle` times, as well as the corresponding `utilization` value are
calculated and returned (similar to [`process.hrtime()`][]).

If `utilization1` and `utilization2` are both passed, then the delta is
calculated between the two arguments. This is a convenience option because,
unlike [`process.hrtime()`][], calculating the ELU is more complex than a
single subtraction.

ELU is similar to CPU utilization, except that it only measures event loop
statistics and not CPU usage. It represents the percentage of time the event
loop has spent outside the event loop's event provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`).
No other CPU idle time is taken into consideration. The following is an example
of how a mostly idle process will have a high ELU.

```js
'use strict';
const { eventLoopUtilization } = require('node:perf_hooks').performance;
const { spawnSync } = require('node:child_process');

setImmediate(() => {
  const elu = eventLoopUtilization();
  spawnSync('sleep', ['5']);
  console.log(eventLoopUtilization(elu).utilization);
});
```

Although the CPU is mostly idle while running this script, the value of
`utilization` is `1`. This is because the call to
[`child_process.spawnSync()`][] blocks the event loop from proceeding.

Passing in a user-defined object instead of the result of a previous call to
`eventLoopUtilization()` will lead to undefined behavior. The return values
are not guaranteed to reflect any correct state of the event loop.

### `performance.getEntries()`

<!-- YAML
added: v16.7.0
-->

* Returns: {PerformanceEntry\[]}

Returns a list of `PerformanceEntry` objects in chronological order with
respect to `performanceEntry.startTime`. If you are only interested in
performance entries of certain types or that have certain names, see
`performance.getEntriesByType()` and `performance.getEntriesByName()`.

added: v16.7.0
-->

* `name` {string}
* `type` {string}
* Returns: {PerformanceEntry\[]}

with respect to `performanceEntry.startTime` whose `performanceEntry.name` is
equal to `name`, and optionally, whose `performanceEntry.entryType` is equal to
`type`.

### `performance.getEntriesByType(type)`

<!-- YAML
added: v16.7.0

changes:
  - version: v16.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37136
    description: Updated to conform to the User Timing Level 3 specification.
-->

* `name` {string}
* `options` {Object}
  * `detail` {any} Additional optional detail to include with the mark.
  * `startTime` {number} An optional timestamp to be used as the mark time.
    **Default**: `performance.now()`.

Creates a new `PerformanceMark` entry in the Performance Timeline. A
`PerformanceMark` is a subclass of `PerformanceEntry` whose
`performanceEntry.entryType` is always `'mark'`, and whose
`performanceEntry.duration` is always `0`. Performance marks are used
to mark specific significant moments in the Performance Timeline.

The created `PerformanceMark` entry is put in the global Performance Timeline
and can be queried with `performance.getEntries`,
`performance.getEntriesByName`, and `performance.getEntriesByType`. When the
observation is performed, the entries should be cleared from the global
Performance Timeline manually with `performance.clearMarks`.

### `performance.markResourceTiming(timingInfo, requestedUrl, initiatorType, global, cacheMode)`

<!-- YAML
added: v18.2.0
-->

* `timingInfo` {Object} [Fetch Timing Info][]

* `initiatorType` {string} The initiator name, e.g: 'fetch'
* `global` {Object}
* `cacheMode` {string} The cache mode must be an empty string ('') or 'local'

_This property is an extension by Node.js. It is not available in Web browsers._

Creates a new `PerformanceResourceTiming` entry in the Resource Timeline. A
`PerformanceResourceTiming` is a subclass of `PerformanceEntry` whose
`performanceEntry.entryType` is always `'resource'`. Performance resources
are used to mark moments in the Resource Timeline.

The created `PerformanceMark` entry is put in the global Resource Timeline
and can be queried with `performance.getEntries`,
`performance.getEntriesByName`, and `performance.getEntriesByType`. When the
observation is performed, the entries should be cleared from the global
Performance Timeline manually with `performance.clearResourceTimings`.

### `performance.measure(name[, startMarkOrOptions[, endMark]])`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
changes:
  - version: v16.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37136
    description: Updated to conform to the User Timing Level 3 specification.
  - version:
      - v13.13.0
      - v12.16.3
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/32651
    description: Make `startMark` and `endMark` parameters optional.

* `startMarkOrOptions` {string|Object} Optional.
  * `detail` {any} Additional optional detail to include with the measure.
  * `duration` {number} Duration between start and end times.
  * `end` {number|string} Timestamp to be used as the end time, or a string
    identifying a previously recorded mark.
  * `start` {number|string} Timestamp to be used as the start time, or a string
    identifying a previously recorded mark.
* `endMark` {string} Optional. Must be omitted if `startMarkOrOptions` is an
  {Object}.

Creates a new `PerformanceMeasure` entry in the Performance Timeline. A
`PerformanceMeasure` is a subclass of `PerformanceEntry` whose
`performanceEntry.entryType` is always `'measure'`, and whose
`performanceEntry.duration` measures the number of milliseconds elapsed since
`startMark` and `endMark`.

The `startMark` argument may identify any _existing_ `PerformanceMark` in the
Performance Timeline, or _may_ identify any of the timestamp properties
provided by the `PerformanceNodeTiming` class. If the named `startMark` does
not exist, an error is thrown.

The optional `endMark` argument must identify any _existing_ `PerformanceMark`
in the Performance Timeline or any of the timestamp properties provided by the
`PerformanceNodeTiming` class. `endMark` will be `performance.now()`
if no parameter is passed, otherwise if the named `endMark` does not exist, an
error will be thrown.

The created `PerformanceMeasure` entry is put in the global Performance Timeline
and can be queried with `performance.getEntries`,
`performance.getEntriesByName`, and `performance.getEntriesByType`. When the
observation is performed, the entries should be cleared from the global
Performance Timeline manually with `performance.clearMeasures`.

    `perf_hooks.createHistogram()` that will record runtime durations in
    nanoseconds.

_This property is an extension by Node.js. It is not available in Web browsers._

Wraps a function within a new function that measures the running time of the
wrapped function. A `PerformanceObserver` must be subscribed to the `'function'`
event type in order for the timing details to be accessed.

```js
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver
} = require('node:perf_hooks');

function someFunction() {
  console.log('hello world');
}

const wrapped = performance.timerify(someFunction);

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries()[0].duration);

  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  obs.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['function'] });

## Class: `perf_hooks.PerformanceObserver`

### `new PerformanceObserver(callback)`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
changes:
  - version: v18.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41678
    description: Passing an invalid callback to the `callback` argument
                 now throws `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` instead of
                 `ERR_INVALID_CALLBACK`.
-->

* `callback` {Function}
  * `list` {PerformanceObserverEntryList}
  * `observer` {PerformanceObserver}

`PerformanceObserver` objects provide notifications when new
`PerformanceEntry` instances have been added to the Performance Timeline.

```js
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver
} = require('node:perf_hooks');

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries());

  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  observer.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['mark'], buffered: true });

performance.mark('test');
```

Because `PerformanceObserver` instances introduce their own additional
performance overhead, instances should not be left subscribed to notifications
indefinitely. Users should disconnect observers as soon as they are no
longer needed.

The `callback` is invoked when a `PerformanceObserver` is
notified about new `PerformanceEntry` instances. The callback receives a
`PerformanceObserverEntryList` instance and a reference to the
`PerformanceObserver`.

### `performanceObserver.disconnect()`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

Disconnects the `PerformanceObserver` instance from all notifications.

### `performanceObserver.observe(options)`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0

  * `lowest` {number|bigint} The lowest discernible value. Must be an integer
    value greater than 0. **Default:** `1`.
  * `highest` {number|bigint} The highest recordable value. Must be an integer

## `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay([options])`

<!-- YAML
added: v11.10.0
-->

* `options` {Object}
  * `resolution` {number} The sampling rate in milliseconds. Must be greater
    than zero. **Default:** `10`.
* Returns: {IntervalHistogram}

_This property is an extension by Node.js. It is not available in Web browsers._

Creates an `IntervalHistogram` object that samples and reports the event loop
delay over time. The delays will be reported in nanoseconds.

Using a timer to detect approximate event loop delay works because the
execution of timers is tied specifically to the lifecycle of the libuv
event loop. That is, a delay in the loop will cause a delay in the execution
of the timer, and those delays are specifically what this API is intended to
detect.

```js
const { monitorEventLoopDelay } = require('node:perf_hooks');
const h = monitorEventLoopDelay({ resolution: 20 });
h.enable();
// Do something.
h.disable();
console.log(h.min);
console.log(h.max);
console.log(h.mean);
console.log(h.stddev);
console.log(h.percentiles);
console.log(h.percentile(50));
console.log(h.percentile(99));
```

## Examples

### Measuring the duration of async operations

The following example uses the [Async Hooks][] and Performance APIs to measure
the actual duration of a Timeout operation (including the amount of time it took
to execute the callback).

```js
'use strict';
const async_hooks = require('node:async_hooks');
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver
} = require('node:perf_hooks');

const set = new Set();
const hook = async_hooks.createHook({
  init(id, type) {
    if (type === 'Timeout') {
      performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Init`);
      set.add(id);
    }
  },
  destroy(id) {
    if (set.has(id)) {
      set.delete(id);
      performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
      performance.measure(`Timeout-${id}`,
                          `Timeout-${id}-Init`,
                          `Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
    }
  }
});
hook.enable();

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries()[0]);
  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  observer.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'], buffered: true });

setTimeout(() => {}, 1000);
```

### Measuring how long it takes to load dependencies

The following example measures the duration of `require()` operations to load
dependencies:

<!-- eslint-disable no-global-assign -->

```js
'use strict';
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver
} = require('node:perf_hooks');
const mod = require('node:module');

// Monkey patch the require function
mod.Module.prototype.require =
  performance.timerify(mod.Module.prototype.require);
require = performance.timerify(require);

// Activate the observer
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries();
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    console.log(`require('${entry[0]}')`, entry.duration);
  });
  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  obs.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['function'], buffered: true });

require('some-module');
```

### Measuring how long one HTTP round-trip takes

The following example is used to trace the time spent by HTTP client
(`OutgoingMessage`) and HTTP request (`IncomingMessage`). For HTTP client,
it means the time interval between starting the request and receiving the
response, and for HTTP request, it means the time interval between receiving
the request and sending the response:

```js
'use strict';
const { PerformanceObserver } = require('node:perf_hooks');
const http = require('node:http');

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});

obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['http'] });

const PORT = 8080;

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('ok');
}).listen(PORT, () => {
  http.get(`http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Measuring how long the `net.connect` (only for TCP) takes when the connection is successful

```js
'use strict';
const { PerformanceObserver } = require('node:perf_hooks');
const net = require('node:net');
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['net'] });
const PORT = 8080;
net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.destroy();
}).listen(PORT, () => {
  net.connect(PORT);
});
```

### Measuring how long the DNS takes when the request is successful

```js
'use strict';
const { PerformanceObserver } = require('node:perf_hooks');
const dns = require('node:dns');
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['dns'] });
dns.lookup('localhost', () => {});
dns.promises.resolve('localhost');
```
