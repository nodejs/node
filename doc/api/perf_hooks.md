# Performance measurement APIs

<!--introduced_in=v8.5.0-->

> Stability: 2 - Stable

<!-- source_link=lib/perf_hooks.js -->

This module provides an implementation of a subset of the W3C
[Web Performance APIs][] as well as additional APIs for
Node.js-specific performance measurements.

Node.js supports the following [Web Performance APIs][]:

* [High Resolution Time][]
* [Performance Timeline][]
* [User Timing][]
* [Resource Timing][]

```mjs
import { performance, PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  console.log(items.getEntries()[0].duration);
  performance.clearMarks();
});
obs.observe({ type: 'measure' });
performance.measure('Start to Now');

performance.mark('A');
doSomeLongRunningProcess(() => {
  performance.measure('A to Now', 'A');

  performance.mark('B');
  performance.measure('A to B', 'A', 'B');
});
```

```cjs
const { PerformanceObserver, performance } = require('node:perf_hooks');

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  console.log(items.getEntries()[0].duration);
});
obs.observe({ type: 'measure' });
performance.measure('Start to Now');

performance.mark('A');
(async function doSomeLongRunningProcess() {
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 5000));
  performance.measure('A to Now', 'A');

  performance.mark('B');
  performance.measure('A to B', 'A', 'B');
})();
```

## `perf_hooks.performance`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

An object that can be used to collect performance metrics from the current
Node.js instance. It is similar to [`window.performance`][] in browsers.

### `performance.clearMarks([name])`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
changes:
  - version: v19.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44483
    description: This method must be called with the `performance` object as
                 the receiver.
-->

* `name` {string}

If `name` is not provided, removes all `PerformanceMark` objects from the
Performance Timeline. If `name` is provided, removes only the named mark.

### `performance.clearMeasures([name])`

<!-- YAML
added: v16.7.0
changes:
  - version: v19.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44483
    description: This method must be called with the `performance` object as
                 the receiver.
-->

* `name` {string}

If `name` is not provided, removes all `PerformanceMeasure` objects from the
Performance Timeline. If `name` is provided, removes only the named measure.

### `performance.clearResourceTimings([name])`

<!-- YAML
added:
  - v18.2.0
  - v16.17.0
changes:
  - version: v19.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44483
    description: This method must be called with the `performance` object as
                 the receiver.
-->

* `name` {string}

If `name` is not provided, removes all `PerformanceResourceTiming` objects from
the Resource Timeline. If `name` is provided, removes only the named resource.

### `performance.eventLoopUtilization([utilization1[, utilization2]])`

<!-- YAML
added:
 - v14.10.0
 - v12.19.0
-->

* `utilization1` {Object} The result of a previous call to
  `eventLoopUtilization()`.
* `utilization2` {Object} The result of a previous call to
  `eventLoopUtilization()` prior to `utilization1`.
* Returns: {Object}
  * `idle` {number}
  * `active` {number}
  * `utilization` {number}

The `eventLoopUtilization()` method returns an object that contains the
cumulative duration of time the event loop has been both idle and active as a
high resolution milliseconds timer. The `utilization` value is the calculated
Event Loop Utilization (ELU).

If bootstrapping has not yet finished on the main thread the properties have
the value of `0`. The ELU is immediately available on [Worker threads][] since
bootstrap happens within the event loop.

Both `utilization1` and `utilization2` are optional parameters.

If `utilization1` is passed, then the delta between the current call's `active`
and `idle` times, as well as the corresponding `utilization` value are
calculated and returned (similar to [`process.hrtime()`][]).

If `utilization1` and `utilization2` are both passed, then the delta is
calculated between the two arguments. This is a convenience option because,
unlike [`process.hrtime()`][], calculating the ELU is more complex than a
single subtraction.

ELU is similar to CPU utilization, except that it only measures event loop
statistics and not CPU usage. It represents the percentage of time the event
loop has spent outside the event loop's event provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`).
No other CPU idle time is taken into consideration. The following is an example
of how a mostly idle process will have a high ELU.

```mjs
import { eventLoopUtilization } from 'node:perf_hooks';
import { spawnSync } from 'node:child_process';

setImmediate(() => {
  const elu = eventLoopUtilization();
  spawnSync('sleep', ['5']);
  console.log(eventLoopUtilization(elu).utilization);
});
```

```cjs
'use strict';
const { eventLoopUtilization } = require('node:perf_hooks').performance;
const { spawnSync } = require('node:child_process');

setImmediate(() => {
  const elu = eventLoopUtilization();
  spawnSync('sleep', ['5']);
  console.log(eventLoopUtilization(elu).utilization);
});
```

Although the CPU is mostly idle while running this script, the value of
`utilization` is `1`. This is because the call to
[`child_process.spawnSync()`][] blocks the event loop from proceeding.

Passing in a user-defined object instead of the result of a previous call to
`eventLoopUtilization()` will lead to undefined behavior. The return values
are not guaranteed to reflect any correct state of the event loop.

### `performance.getEntries()`

<!-- YAML
added: v16.7.0
changes:
  - version: v19.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44483

Creates a new `PerformanceMark` entry in the Performance Timeline. A
`PerformanceMark` is a subclass of `PerformanceEntry` whose
`performanceEntry.entryType` is always `'mark'`, and whose
`performanceEntry.duration` is always `0`. Performance marks are used
to mark specific significant moments in the Performance Timeline.

The created `PerformanceMark` entry is put in the global Performance Timeline
and can be queried with `performance.getEntries`,
`performance.getEntriesByName`, and `performance.getEntriesByType`. When the
observation is performed, the entries should be cleared from the global
Performance Timeline manually with `performance.clearMarks`.

### `performance.markResourceTiming(timingInfo, requestedUrl, initiatorType, global, cacheMode, bodyInfo, responseStatus[, deliveryType])`

<!-- YAML
added:
  - v18.2.0
  - v16.17.0

* `deliveryType` {string} The delivery type.  **Default:** `''`.

_This property is an extension by Node.js. It is not available in Web browsers._

Creates a new `PerformanceResourceTiming` entry in the Resource Timeline. A
`PerformanceResourceTiming` is a subclass of `PerformanceEntry` whose
`performanceEntry.entryType` is always `'resource'`. Performance resources
are used to mark moments in the Resource Timeline.

The created `PerformanceMark` entry is put in the global Resource Timeline
and can be queried with `performance.getEntries`,
`performance.getEntriesByName`, and `performance.getEntriesByType`. When the
observation is performed, the entries should be cleared from the global
Performance Timeline manually with `performance.clearResourceTimings`.

### `performance.measure(name[, startMarkOrOptions[, endMark]])`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
changes:
  - version: v19.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44483
    description: This method must be called with the `performance` object as
                 the receiver.
  - version: v16.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/37136
    description: Updated to conform to the User Timing Level 3 specification.

    identifying a previously recorded mark.
  * `start` {number|string} Timestamp to be used as the start time, or a string
    identifying a previously recorded mark.
* `endMark` {string} Optional. Must be omitted if `startMarkOrOptions` is an
  {Object}.

Creates a new `PerformanceMeasure` entry in the Performance Timeline. A
`PerformanceMeasure` is a subclass of `PerformanceEntry` whose
`performanceEntry.entryType` is always `'measure'`, and whose
`performanceEntry.duration` measures the number of milliseconds elapsed since
`startMark` and `endMark`.

The `startMark` argument may identify any _existing_ `PerformanceMark` in the
Performance Timeline, or _may_ identify any of the timestamp properties
provided by the `PerformanceNodeTiming` class. If the named `startMark` does
not exist, an error is thrown.

The optional `endMark` argument must identify any _existing_ `PerformanceMark`
in the Performance Timeline or any of the timestamp properties provided by the
`PerformanceNodeTiming` class. `endMark` will be `performance.now()`
if no parameter is passed, otherwise if the named `endMark` does not exist, an
error will be thrown.

The created `PerformanceMeasure` entry is put in the global Performance Timeline
and can be queried with `performance.getEntries`,
`performance.getEntriesByName`, and `performance.getEntriesByType`. When the
observation is performed, the entries should be cleared from the global
Performance Timeline manually with `performance.clearMeasures`.

_This property is an extension by Node.js. It is not available in Web browsers._

Wraps a function within a new function that measures the running time of the
wrapped function. A `PerformanceObserver` must be subscribed to the `'function'`
event type in order for the timing details to be accessed.

```mjs
import { performance, PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';

function someFunction() {
  console.log('hello world');
}

const wrapped = performance.timerify(someFunction);

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries()[0].duration);

  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  obs.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['function'] });

// A performance timeline entry will be created
wrapped();
```

```cjs
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver,
} = require('node:perf_hooks');

function someFunction() {
  console.log('hello world');
}

const wrapped = performance.timerify(someFunction);

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries()[0].duration);

  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  obs.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['function'] });

// A performance timeline entry will be created
wrapped();
```

If the wrapped function returns a promise, a finally handler will be attached
to the promise and the duration will be reported once the finally handler is
invoked.

### `performance.toJSON()`

is similar to [`window.performance.toJSON`][] in browsers.

#### Event: `'resourcetimingbufferfull'`

<!-- YAML
added: v18.8.0
-->

The `'resourcetimingbufferfull'` event is fired when the global performance
resource timing buffer is full. Adjust resource timing buffer size with
`performance.setResourceTimingBufferSize()` or clear the buffer with
`performance.clearResourceTimings()` in the event listener to allow
more entries to be added to the performance timeline buffer.

### HTTP ('http') Details

When `performanceEntry.type` is equal to `'http'`, the
`performanceNodeEntry.detail` property will be an {Object} containing
additional information.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `HttpClient`, the `detail`
will contain the following properties: `req`, `res`. And the `req` property
will be an {Object} containing `method`, `url`, `headers`, the `res` property
will be an {Object} containing `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, `headers`.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `HttpRequest`, the `detail`
will contain the following properties: `req`, `res`. And the `req` property
will be an {Object} containing `method`, `url`, `headers`, the `res` property
will be an {Object} containing `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, `headers`.

This could add additional memory overhead and should only be used for
diagnostic purposes, not left turned on in production by default.

### HTTP/2 ('http2') Details

When `performanceEntry.type` is equal to `'http2'`, the
`performanceNodeEntry.detail` property will be an {Object} containing
additional performance information.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `Http2Stream`, the `detail`
will contain the following properties:

* `bytesRead` {number} The number of `DATA` frame bytes received for this
  `Http2Stream`.
* `bytesWritten` {number} The number of `DATA` frame bytes sent for this
  `Http2Stream`.
* `id` {number} The identifier of the associated `Http2Stream`
* `timeToFirstByte` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed between the
  `PerformanceEntry` `startTime` and the reception of the first `DATA` frame.
* `timeToFirstByteSent` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed between
  the `PerformanceEntry` `startTime` and sending of the first `DATA` frame.
* `timeToFirstHeader` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed between the
  `PerformanceEntry` `startTime` and the reception of the first header.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `Http2Session`, the `detail` will
contain the following properties:

* `bytesRead` {number} The number of bytes received for this `Http2Session`.
* `bytesWritten` {number} The number of bytes sent for this `Http2Session`.
* `framesReceived` {number} The number of HTTP/2 frames received by the
  `Http2Session`.
* `framesSent` {number} The number of HTTP/2 frames sent by the `Http2Session`.
* `maxConcurrentStreams` {number} The maximum number of streams concurrently
  open during the lifetime of the `Http2Session`.
* `pingRTT` {number} The number of milliseconds elapsed since the transmission
  of a `PING` frame and the reception of its acknowledgment. Only present if

### Timerify ('function') Details

When `performanceEntry.type` is equal to `'function'`, the
`performanceNodeEntry.detail` property will be an {Array} listing
the input arguments to the timed function.

### Net ('net') Details

When `performanceEntry.type` is equal to `'net'`, the
`performanceNodeEntry.detail` property will be an {Object} containing
additional information.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `connect`, the `detail`
will contain the following properties: `host`, `port`.

### DNS ('dns') Details

When `performanceEntry.type` is equal to `'dns'`, the
`performanceNodeEntry.detail` property will be an {Object} containing
additional information.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `lookup`, the `detail`
will contain the following properties: `hostname`, `family`, `hints`, `verbatim`,
`addresses`.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `lookupService`, the `detail` will
contain the following properties: `host`, `port`, `hostname`, `service`.

If `performanceEntry.name` is equal to `queryxxx` or `getHostByAddr`, the `detail` will
contain the following properties: `host`, `ttl`, `result`. The value of `result` is
same as the result of `queryxxx` or `getHostByAddr`.

## Class: `PerformanceNodeTiming`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

* Extends: {PerformanceEntry}

_This property is an extension by Node.js. It is not available in Web browsers._

Provides timing details for Node.js itself. The constructor of this class
is not exposed to users.

### `performanceNodeTiming.bootstrapComplete`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

* {number}

The high resolution millisecond timestamp at which the Node.js process
completed bootstrapping. If bootstrapping has not yet finished, the property
has the value of -1.

### `performanceNodeTiming.environment`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

* {number}

The high resolution millisecond timestamp at which the Node.js environment was
initialized.

### `performanceNodeTiming.idleTime`

<!-- YAML
added:
  - v14.10.0
  - v12.19.0
-->

* {number}

The high resolution millisecond timestamp of the amount of time the event loop
has been idle within the event loop's event provider (e.g. `epoll_wait`). This
does not take CPU usage into consideration. If the event loop has not yet
started (e.g., in the first tick of the main script), the property has the
value of 0.

### `performanceNodeTiming.loopExit`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

* {number}

The high resolution millisecond timestamp at which the Node.js event loop
exited. If the event loop has not yet exited, the property has the value of -1.
It can only have a value of not -1 in a handler of the [`'exit'`][] event.

### `performanceNodeTiming.loopStart`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

* {number}

The high resolution millisecond timestamp at which the Node.js event loop
started. If the event loop has not yet started (e.g., in the first tick of the
main script), the property has the value of -1.

### `performanceNodeTiming.nodeStart`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

* {number}

The high resolution millisecond timestamp at which the Node.js process was
initialized.

### `performanceNodeTiming.uvMetricsInfo`

<!-- YAML
added:
  - v22.8.0

  * `loopCount` {number} Number of event loop iterations.
  * `events` {number} Number of events that have been processed by the event handler.
  * `eventsWaiting` {number} Number of events that were waiting to be processed when the event provider was called.

This is a wrapper to the `uv_metrics_info` function.
It returns the current set of event loop metrics.

It is recommended to use this property inside a function whose execution was
scheduled using `setImmediate` to avoid collecting metrics before finishing all
operations scheduled during the current loop iteration.

```cjs
const { performance } = require('node:perf_hooks');

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log(performance.nodeTiming.uvMetricsInfo);
});
```

### `new PerformanceObserver(callback)`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
changes:
  - version: v18.0.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/41678
    description: Passing an invalid callback to the `callback` argument
                 now throws `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE` instead of
                 `ERR_INVALID_CALLBACK`.
-->

* `callback` {Function}
  * `list` {PerformanceObserverEntryList}
  * `observer` {PerformanceObserver}

`PerformanceObserver` objects provide notifications when new
`PerformanceEntry` instances have been added to the Performance Timeline.

```mjs
import { performance, PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries());

  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  observer.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['mark'], buffered: true });

performance.mark('test');
```

```cjs
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver,
} = require('node:perf_hooks');

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries());

  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  observer.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['mark'], buffered: true });

performance.mark('test');
```

Because `PerformanceObserver` instances introduce their own additional
performance overhead, instances should not be left subscribed to notifications
indefinitely. Users should disconnect observers as soon as they are no
longer needed.

The `callback` is invoked when a `PerformanceObserver` is
notified about new `PerformanceEntry` instances. The callback receives a
`PerformanceObserverEntryList` instance and a reference to the
`PerformanceObserver`.

### `performanceObserver.disconnect()`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0
-->

Disconnects the `PerformanceObserver` instance from all notifications.

### `performanceObserver.observe(options)`

<!-- YAML
added: v8.5.0

    description: Updated to conform to User Timing Level 3. The
                 buffered option has been removed.
-->

* `options` {Object}
  * `type` {string} A single {PerformanceEntry} type. Must not be given
    if `entryTypes` is already specified.
  * `entryTypes` {string\[]} An array of strings identifying the types of
    {PerformanceEntry} instances the observer is interested in. If not
    provided an error will be thrown.
  * `buffered` {boolean} If true, the observer callback is called with a
    list global `PerformanceEntry` buffered entries. If false, only
    `PerformanceEntry`s created after the time point are sent to the
    observer callback. **Default:** `false`.

Subscribes the {PerformanceObserver} instance to notifications of new
{PerformanceEntry} instances identified either by `options.entryTypes`
or `options.type`:

```mjs
import { performance, PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  // Called once asynchronously. `list` contains three items.
});
obs.observe({ type: 'mark' });

for (let n = 0; n < 3; n++)
  performance.mark(`test${n}`);
```

```cjs
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver,

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  // Called once asynchronously. `list` contains three items.
});

for (let n = 0; n < 3; n++)
  performance.mark(`test${n}`);
```

* Returns: {IntervalHistogram}

_This property is an extension by Node.js. It is not available in Web browsers._

Creates an `IntervalHistogram` object that samples and reports the event loop
delay over time. The delays will be reported in nanoseconds.

Using a timer to detect approximate event loop delay works because the
execution of timers is tied specifically to the lifecycle of the libuv
event loop. That is, a delay in the loop will cause a delay in the execution
of the timer, and those delays are specifically what this API is intended to
detect.

```mjs
import { monitorEventLoopDelay } from 'node:perf_hooks';

const h = monitorEventLoopDelay({ resolution: 20 });

## Examples

### Measuring the duration of async operations

The following example uses the [Async Hooks][] and Performance APIs to measure
the actual duration of a Timeout operation (including the amount of time it took
to execute the callback).

```mjs
import { createHook } from 'node:async_hooks';
import { performance, PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';

const set = new Set();
const hook = createHook({
  init(id, type) {
    if (type === 'Timeout') {
      performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Init`);
      set.add(id);
    }
  },
  destroy(id) {
    if (set.has(id)) {
      set.delete(id);
      performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
      performance.measure(`Timeout-${id}`,
                          `Timeout-${id}-Init`,
                          `Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
    }
  },
});
hook.enable();

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries()[0]);
  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  observer.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'], buffered: true });

setTimeout(() => {}, 1000);
```

```cjs
'use strict';
const async_hooks = require('node:async_hooks');
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver,
} = require('node:perf_hooks');

const set = new Set();
const hook = async_hooks.createHook({
  init(id, type) {
    if (type === 'Timeout') {
      performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Init`);
      set.add(id);
    }
  },
  destroy(id) {
    if (set.has(id)) {
      set.delete(id);
      performance.mark(`Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
      performance.measure(`Timeout-${id}`,
                          `Timeout-${id}-Init`,
                          `Timeout-${id}-Destroy`);
    }
  },
});
hook.enable();

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list, observer) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries()[0]);
  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  observer.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['measure'] });

setTimeout(() => {}, 1000);
```

### Measuring how long it takes to load dependencies

The following example measures the duration of `require()` operations to load
dependencies:

<!-- eslint-disable no-global-assign -->

```mjs
import { performance, PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';

// Activate the observer
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries();
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    console.log(`import('${entry[0]}')`, entry.duration);
  });
  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  obs.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['function'], buffered: true });

const timedImport = performance.timerify(async (module) => {
  return await import(module);
});

await timedImport('some-module');
```

```cjs
'use strict';
const {
  performance,
  PerformanceObserver,
} = require('node:perf_hooks');
const mod = require('node:module');

// Monkey patch the require function
mod.Module.prototype.require =
  performance.timerify(mod.Module.prototype.require);
require = performance.timerify(require);

// Activate the observer
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries();
  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    console.log(`require('${entry[0]}')`, entry.duration);
  });
  performance.clearMarks();
  performance.clearMeasures();
  obs.disconnect();
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['function'] });

require('some-module');
```

### Measuring how long one HTTP round-trip takes

The following example is used to trace the time spent by HTTP client
(`OutgoingMessage`) and HTTP request (`IncomingMessage`). For HTTP client,
it means the time interval between starting the request and receiving the
response, and for HTTP request, it means the time interval between receiving
the request and sending the response:

```mjs
import { PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';
import { createServer, get } from 'node:http';

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});

obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['http'] });

const PORT = 8080;

createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('ok');
}).listen(PORT, () => {
  get(`http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`);
});
```

```cjs
'use strict';
const { PerformanceObserver } = require('node:perf_hooks');
const http = require('node:http');

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});

obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['http'] });

const PORT = 8080;

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end('ok');
}).listen(PORT, () => {
  http.get(`http://127.0.0.1:${PORT}`);
});
```

### Measuring how long the `net.connect` (only for TCP) takes when the connection is successful

```mjs
import { PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';
import { connect, createServer } from 'node:net';

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['net'] });
const PORT = 8080;
createServer((socket) => {
  socket.destroy();
}).listen(PORT, () => {
  connect(PORT);
});
```

```cjs
'use strict';
const { PerformanceObserver } = require('node:perf_hooks');
const net = require('node:net');
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['net'] });
const PORT = 8080;
net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.destroy();
}).listen(PORT, () => {
  net.connect(PORT);
});
```

### Measuring how long the DNS takes when the request is successful

```mjs
import { PerformanceObserver } from 'node:perf_hooks';
import { lookup, promises } from 'node:dns';

const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['dns'] });
lookup('localhost', () => {});
promises.resolve('localhost');
```

```cjs
'use strict';
const { PerformanceObserver } = require('node:perf_hooks');
const dns = require('node:dns');
const obs = new PerformanceObserver((items) => {
  items.getEntries().forEach((item) => {
    console.log(item);
  });
});
obs.observe({ entryTypes: ['dns'] });
dns.lookup('localhost', () => {});
dns.promises.resolve('localhost');
```
