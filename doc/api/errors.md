# Errors

<!--introduced_in=v4.0.0-->

<!--type=misc-->

Applications running in Node.js will generally experience four categories of
errors:

* Standard JavaScript errors such as {EvalError}, {SyntaxError}, {RangeError},
  {ReferenceError}, {TypeError}, and {URIError}.
* System errors triggered by underlying operating system constraints such
  as attempting to open a file that does not exist or attempting to send data
  over a closed socket.
* User-specified errors triggered by application code.
* `AssertionError`s are a special class of error that can be triggered when
  Node.js detects an exceptional logic violation that should never occur. These
  are raised typically by the `node:assert` module.

All JavaScript and system errors raised by Node.js inherit from, or are
instances of, the standard JavaScript {Error} class and are guaranteed
to provide _at least_ the properties available on that class.

## Error propagation and interception

<!--type=misc-->

Node.js supports several mechanisms for propagating and handling errors that
occur while an application is running. How these errors are reported and
handled depends entirely on the type of `Error` and the style of the API that is
called.

All JavaScript errors are handled as exceptions that _immediately_ generate
and throw an error using the standard JavaScript `throw` mechanism. These
are handled using the [`try…catch` construct][try-catch] provided by the
JavaScript language.

```js
// Throws with a ReferenceError because z is not defined.
try {
  const m = 1;
  const n = m + z;
} catch (err) {
  // Handle the error here.
}
```

Any use of the JavaScript `throw` mechanism will raise an exception that
_must_ be handled or the Node.js process will exit immediately.

With few exceptions, _Synchronous_ APIs (any blocking method that does not
return a {Promise} nor accept a `callback` function, such as
[`fs.readFileSync`][]), will use `throw` to report errors.

Errors that occur within _Asynchronous APIs_ may be reported in multiple ways:

* Some asynchronous methods returns a {Promise}, you should always take into
  account that it might be rejected. See [`--unhandled-rejections`][] flag for
  how the process will react to an unhandled promise rejection.

  <!-- eslint-disable no-useless-return -->

  ```js
  const fs = require('node:fs/promises');

  (async () => {
    let data;
    try {
      data = await fs.readFile('a file that does not exist');
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);
      return;
    }
    // Otherwise handle the data
  })();
  ```

* Most asynchronous methods that accept a `callback` function will accept an
  `Error` object passed as the first argument to that function. If that first
  argument is not `null` and is an instance of `Error`, then an error occurred
  that should be handled.

  <!-- eslint-disable no-useless-return -->

  ```js
  const fs = require('node:fs');
  fs.readFile('a file that does not exist', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error('There was an error reading the file!', err);
      return;
    }
    // Otherwise handle the data
  });
  ```

* When an asynchronous method is called on an object that is an
  [`EventEmitter`][], errors can be routed to that object's `'error'` event.

  ```js
  const net = require('node:net');
  const connection = net.connect('localhost');

  // Adding an 'error' event handler to a stream:
  connection.on('error', (err) => {
    // If the connection is reset by the server, or if it can't
    // connect at all, or on any sort of error encountered by
    // the connection, the error will be sent here.
    console.error(err);
  });

  connection.pipe(process.stdout);
  ```

* A handful of typically asynchronous methods in the Node.js API may still
  use the `throw` mechanism to raise exceptions that must be handled using
  `try…catch`. There is no comprehensive list of such methods; please
  refer to the documentation of each method to determine the appropriate
  error handling mechanism required.

The use of the `'error'` event mechanism is most common for [stream-based][]
and [event emitter-based][] APIs, which themselves represent a series of
asynchronous operations over time (as opposed to a single operation that may
pass or fail).

For _all_ [`EventEmitter`][] objects, if an `'error'` event handler is not
provided, the error will be thrown, causing the Node.js process to report an
uncaught exception and crash unless either: a handler has been registered for
the [`'uncaughtException'`][] event, or the deprecated [`node:domain`][domains]
module is used.

```js
const EventEmitter = require('node:events');
const ee = new EventEmitter();

setImmediate(() => {
  // This will crash the process because no 'error' event
  // handler has been added.
  ee.emit('error', new Error('This will crash'));
});
```

Errors generated in this way _cannot_ be intercepted using `try…catch` as
they are thrown _after_ the calling code has already exited.

Developers must refer to the documentation for each method to determine
exactly how errors raised by those methods are propagated.

## Class: `Error`

<!--type=class-->

A generic JavaScript {Error} object that does not denote any specific
circumstance of why the error occurred. `Error` objects capture a "stack trace"
detailing the point in the code at which the `Error` was instantiated, and may
provide a text description of the error.

All errors generated by Node.js, including all system and JavaScript errors,
will either be instances of, or inherit from, the `Error` class.

### `new Error(message[, options])`

* `message` {string}
* `options` {Object}
  * `cause` {any} The error that caused the newly created error.

Creates a new `Error` object and sets the `error.message` property to the
provided text message. If an object is passed as `message`, the text message
is generated by calling `String(message)`. If the `cause` option is provided,
it is assigned to the `error.cause` property. The `error.stack` property will
represent the point in the code at which `new Error()` was called. Stack traces
are dependent on [V8's stack trace API][]. Stack traces extend only to either
(a) the beginning of _synchronous code execution_, or (b) the number of frames
given by the property `Error.stackTraceLimit`, whichever is smaller.

### `Error.captureStackTrace(targetObject[, constructorOpt])`

* `targetObject` {Object}
* `constructorOpt` {Function}

Creates a `.stack` property on `targetObject`, which when accessed returns
a string representing the location in the code at which
`Error.captureStackTrace()` was called.

```js
const myObject = {};
Error.captureStackTrace(myObject);
myObject.stack;  // Similar to `new Error().stack`
```

The first line of the trace will be prefixed with
`${myObject.name}: ${myObject.message}`.

The optional `constructorOpt` argument accepts a function. If given, all frames
above `constructorOpt`, including `constructorOpt`, will be omitted from the
generated stack trace.

The `constructorOpt` argument is useful for hiding implementation
details of error generation from the user. For instance:

```js
function a() {
  b();
}

function b() {
  c();
}

function c() {
  // Create an error without stack trace to avoid calculating the stack trace twice.
  const { stackTraceLimit } = Error;
  Error.stackTraceLimit = 0;
  const error = new Error();
  Error.stackTraceLimit = stackTraceLimit;

  // Capture the stack trace above function b
  Error.captureStackTrace(error, b); // Neither function c, nor b is included in the stack trace
  throw error;
}

a();
```

### `Error.stackTraceLimit`

* {number}

The `Error.stackTraceLimit` property specifies the number of stack frames
collected by a stack trace (whether generated by `new Error().stack` or
`Error.captureStackTrace(obj)`).

The default value is `10` but may be set to any valid JavaScript number. Changes
will affect any stack trace captured _after_ the value has been changed.

If set to a non-number value, or set to a negative number, stack traces will
not capture any frames.

### `error.cause`

<!-- YAML
added: v16.9.0
-->

* {any}

If present, the `error.cause` property is the underlying cause of the `Error`.
It is used when catching an error and throwing a new one with a different
message or code in order to still have access to the original error.

The `error.cause` property is typically set by calling
`new Error(message, { cause })`. It is not set by the constructor if the
`cause` option is not provided.

This property allows errors to be chained. When serializing `Error` objects,
[`util.inspect()`][] recursively serializes `error.cause` if it is set.

```js
const cause = new Error('The remote HTTP server responded with a 500 status');
const symptom = new Error('The message failed to send', { cause });

console.log(symptom);
// Prints:
//   Error: The message failed to send
//       at REPL2:1:17
//       at Script.runInThisContext (node:vm:130:12)
//       ... 7 lines matching cause stack trace ...
//       at [_line] [as _line] (node:internal/readline/interface:886:18) {
//     [cause]: Error: The remote HTTP server responded with a 500 status
//         at REPL1:1:15
//         at Script.runInThisContext (node:vm:130:12)
//         at REPLServer.defaultEval (node:repl:574:29)
//         at bound (node:domain:426:15)
//         at REPLServer.runBound [as eval] (node:domain:437:12)
//         at REPLServer.onLine (node:repl:902:10)
//         at REPLServer.emit (node:events:549:35)
//         at REPLServer.emit (node:domain:482:12)
//         at [_onLine] [as _onLine] (node:internal/readline/interface:425:12)
//         at [_line] [as _line] (node:internal/readline/interface:886:18)
```

### `error.code`

* {string}

The `error.code` property is a string label that identifies the kind of error.
`error.code` is the most stable way to identify an error. It will only change
between major versions of Node.js. In contrast, `error.message` strings may
change between any versions of Node.js. See [Node.js error codes][] for details
about specific codes.

### `error.message`

* {string}

The `error.message` property is the string description of the error as set by
calling `new Error(message)`. The `message` passed to the constructor will also
appear in the first line of the stack trace of the `Error`, however changing
this property after the `Error` object is created _may not_ change the first
line of the stack trace (for example, when `error.stack` is read before this
property is changed).

```js
const err = new Error('The message');
console.error(err.message);
// Prints: The message
```

### `error.stack`

* {string}

The `error.stack` property is a string describing the point in the code at which
the `Error` was instantiated.

```console
Error: Things keep happening!
   at /home/gbusey/file.js:525:2
   at Frobnicator.refrobulate (/home/gbusey/business-logic.js:424:21)
   at Actor.<anonymous> (/home/gbusey/actors.js:400:8)
   at increaseSynergy (/home/gbusey/actors.js:701:6)
```

The first line is formatted as `<error class name>: <error message>`, and
is followed by a series of stack frames (each line beginning with "at ").
Each frame describes a call site within the code that lead to the error being
generated. V8 attempts to display a name for each function (by variable name,
function name, or object method name), but occasionally it will not be able to
find a suitable name. If V8 cannot determine a name for the function, only
location information will be displayed for that frame. Otherwise, the
determined function name will be displayed with location information appended
in parentheses.

Frames are only generated for JavaScript functions. If, for example, execution
synchronously passes through a C++ addon function called `cheetahify` which
itself calls a JavaScript function, the frame representing the `cheetahify` call
will not be present in the stack traces:

```js
const cheetahify = require('./native-binding.node');

function makeFaster() {
  // `cheetahify()` *synchronously* calls speedy.
  cheetahify(function speedy() {
    throw new Error('oh no!');
  });
}

makeFaster();
// will throw:
//   /home/gbusey/file.js:6
//       throw new Error('oh no!');
//           ^
//   Error: oh no!
//       at speedy (/home/gbusey/file.js:6:11)
//       at makeFaster (/home/gbusey/file.js:5:3)
//       at Object.<anonymous> (/home/gbusey/file.js:10:1)
//       at Module._compile (module.js:456:26)
//       at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:474:10)
//       at Module.load (module.js:356:32)
//       at Function.Module._load (module.js:312:12)
//       at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:497:10)
//       at startup (node.js:119:16)
//       at node.js:906:3
```

The location information will be one of:

* `native`, if the frame represents a call internal to V8 (as in `[].forEach`).
* `plain-filename.js:line:column`, if the frame represents a call internal
  to Node.js.
* `/absolute/path/to/file.js:line:column`, if the frame represents a call in
  a user program (using CommonJS module system), or its dependencies.
* `<transport-protocol>:///url/to/module/file.mjs:line:column`, if the frame
  represents a call in a user program (using ES module system), or
  its dependencies.

The string representing the stack trace is lazily generated when the
`error.stack` property is **accessed**.

The number of frames captured by the stack trace is bounded by the smaller of
`Error.stackTraceLimit` or the number of available frames on the current event
loop tick.

## Class: `AssertionError`

* Extends: {errors.Error}

Indicates the failure of an assertion. For details, see
[`Class: assert.AssertionError`][].

## Class: `RangeError`

* Extends: {errors.Error}

Indicates that a provided argument was not within the set or range of
acceptable values for a function; whether that is a numeric range, or
outside the set of options for a given function parameter.

```js
require('node:net').connect(-1);
// Throws "RangeError: "port" option should be >= 0 and < 65536: -1"
```

Node.js will generate and throw `RangeError` instances _immediately_ as a form
of argument validation.

## Class: `ReferenceError`

* Extends: {errors.Error}

Indicates that an attempt is being made to access a variable that is not
defined. Such errors commonly indicate typos in code, or an otherwise broken
program.

While client code may generate and propagate these errors, in practice, only V8
will do so.

```js
doesNotExist;
// Throws ReferenceError, doesNotExist is not a variable in this program.
```

Unless an application is dynamically generating and running code,
`ReferenceError` instances indicate a bug in the code or its dependencies.

## Class: `SyntaxError`

* Extends: {errors.Error}

Indicates that a program is not valid JavaScript. These errors may only be
generated and propagated as a result of code evaluation. Code evaluation may
happen as a result of `eval`, `Function`, `require`, or [vm][]. These errors
are almost always indicative of a broken program.

```js
try {
  require('node:vm').runInThisContext('binary ! isNotOk');
} catch (err) {
  // 'err' will be a SyntaxError.
}
```

`SyntaxError` instances are unrecoverable in the context that created them –
they may only be caught by other contexts.

## Class: `SystemError`

* Extends: {errors.Error}

Node.js generates system errors when exceptions occur within its runtime
environment. These usually occur when an application violates an operating
system constraint. For example, a system error will occur if an application
attempts to read a file that does not exist.

* `address` {string} If present, the address to which a network connection
  failed
* `code` {string} The string error code
* `dest` {string} If present, the file path destination when reporting a file
  system error
* `errno` {number} The system-provided error number
* `info` {Object} If present, extra details about the error condition
* `message` {string} A system-provided human-readable description of the error
* `path` {string} If present, the file path when reporting a file system error
* `port` {number} If present, the network connection port that is not available
* `syscall` {string} The name of the system call that triggered the error

### `error.address`

* {string}

If present, `error.address` is a string describing the address to which a
network connection failed.

### `error.code`

* {string}

The `error.code` property is a string representing the error code.

### `error.dest`

* {string}

If present, `error.dest` is the file path destination when reporting a file
system error.

### `error.errno`

* {number}

The `error.errno` property is a negative number which corresponds
to the error code defined in [`libuv Error handling`][].

On Windows the error number provided by the system will be normalized by libuv.

To get the string representation of the error code, use
[`util.getSystemErrorName(error.errno)`][].

### `error.info`

* {Object}

If present, `error.info` is an object with details about the error condition.

### `error.message`

* {string}

`error.message` is a system-provided human-readable description of the error.

### `error.path`

* {string}

If present, `error.path` is a string containing a relevant invalid pathname.

### `error.port`

* {number}

If present, `error.port` is the network connection port that is not available.

### `error.syscall`

* {string}

The `error.syscall` property is a string describing the [syscall][] that failed.

### Common system errors

This is a list of system errors commonly-encountered when writing a Node.js
program. For a comprehensive list, see the [`errno`(3) man page][].

* `EACCES` (Permission denied): An attempt was made to access a file in a way
  forbidden by its file access permissions.

* `EADDRINUSE` (Address already in use): An attempt to bind a server
  ([`net`][], [`http`][], or [`https`][]) to a local address failed due to
  another server on the local system already occupying that address.

* `ECONNREFUSED` (Connection refused): No connection could be made because the
  target machine actively refused it. This usually results from trying to
  connect to a service that is inactive on the foreign host.

* `ECONNRESET` (Connection reset by peer): A connection was forcibly closed by
  a peer. This normally results from a loss of the connection on the remote
  socket due to a timeout or reboot. Commonly encountered via the [`http`][]
  and [`net`][] modules.

* `EEXIST` (File exists): An existing file was the target of an operation that
  required that the target not exist.

* `EISDIR` (Is a directory): An operation expected a file, but the given
  pathname was a directory.

* `EMFILE` (Too many open files in system): Maximum number of
  [file descriptors][] allowable on the system has been reached, and
  requests for another descriptor cannot be fulfilled until at least one
  has been closed. This is encountered when opening many files at once in
  parallel, especially on systems (in particular, macOS) where there is a low
  file descriptor limit for processes. To remedy a low limit, run
  `ulimit -n 2048` in the same shell that will run the Node.js process.

* `ENOENT` (No such file or directory): Commonly raised by [`fs`][] operations
  to indicate that a component of the specified pathname does not exist. No
  entity (file or directory) could be found by the given path.

* `ENOTDIR` (Not a directory): A component of the given pathname existed, but
  was not a directory as expected. Commonly raised by [`fs.readdir`][].

* `ENOTEMPTY` (Directory not empty): A directory with entries was the target
  of an operation that requires an empty directory, usually [`fs.unlink`][].

* `ENOTFOUND` (DNS lookup failed): Indicates a DNS failure of either
  `EAI_NODATA` or `EAI_NONAME`. This is not a standard POSIX error.

* `EPERM` (Operation not permitted): An attempt was made to perform an
  operation that requires elevated privileges.

* `EPIPE` (Broken pipe): A write on a pipe, socket, or FIFO for which there is
  no process to read the data. Commonly encountered at the [`net`][] and
  [`http`][] layers, indicative that the remote side of the stream being
  written to has been closed.

* `ETIMEDOUT` (Operation timed out): A connect or send request failed because
  the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time. Usually
  encountered by [`http`][] or [`net`][]. Often a sign that a `socket.end()`
  was not properly called.

## Class: `TypeError`

* Extends {errors.Error}

Indicates that a provided argument is not an allowable type. For example,
passing a function to a parameter which expects a string would be a `TypeError`.

```js
require('node:url').parse(() => { });
// Throws TypeError, since it expected a string.
```

Node.js will generate and throw `TypeError` instances _immediately_ as a form
of argument validation.

## Exceptions vs. errors

<!--type=misc-->

A JavaScript exception is a value that is thrown as a result of an invalid
operation or as the target of a `throw` statement. While it is not required
that these values are instances of `Error` or classes which inherit from
`Error`, all exceptions thrown by Node.js or the JavaScript runtime _will_ be
instances of `Error`.

Some exceptions are _unrecoverable_ at the JavaScript layer. Such exceptions
will _always_ cause the Node.js process to crash. Examples include `assert()`
checks or `abort()` calls in the C++ layer.

## OpenSSL errors

Errors originating in `crypto` or `tls` are of class `Error`, and in addition to
the standard `.code` and `.message` properties, may have some additional
OpenSSL-specific properties.

### `error.opensslErrorStack`

An array of errors that can give context to where in the OpenSSL library an
error originates from.

### `error.function`

The OpenSSL function the error originates in.

### `error.library`

The OpenSSL library the error originates in.

### `error.reason`

A human-readable string describing the reason for the error.

<a id="nodejs-error-codes"></a>

## Node.js error codes

<a id="ABORT_ERR"></a>

### `ABORT_ERR`

<!-- YAML
added: v15.0.0
-->

Used when an operation has been aborted (typically using an `AbortController`).

APIs _not_ using `AbortSignal`s typically do not raise an error with this code.

This code does not use the regular `ERR_*` convention Node.js errors use in
order to be compatible with the web platform's `AbortError`.

<a id="ERR_ACCESS_DENIED"></a>

### `ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`

A special type of error that is triggered whenever Node.js tries to get access
to a resource restricted by the [Permission Model][].

<a id="ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ARGUMENT"></a>

### `ERR_AMBIGUOUS_ARGUMENT`

A function argument is being used in a way that suggests that the function
signature may be misunderstood. This is thrown by the `node:assert` module when
the `message` parameter in `assert.throws(block, message)` matches the error
message thrown by `block` because that usage suggests that the user believes
`message` is the expected message rather than the message the `AssertionError`
will display if `block` does not throw.

<a id="ERR_ARG_NOT_ITERABLE"></a>

### `ERR_ARG_NOT_ITERABLE`

An iterable argument (i.e. a value that works with `for...of` loops) was
required, but not provided to a Node.js API.

<a id="ERR_ASSERTION"></a>

### `ERR_ASSERTION`

A special type of error that can be triggered whenever Node.js detects an
exceptional logic violation that should never occur. These are raised typically
by the `node:assert` module.

<a id="ERR_ASYNC_CALLBACK"></a>

### `ERR_ASYNC_CALLBACK`

An attempt was made to register something that is not a function as an
`AsyncHooks` callback.

<a id="ERR_ASYNC_TYPE"></a>

### `ERR_ASYNC_TYPE`

The type of an asynchronous resource was invalid. Users are also able
to define their own types if using the public embedder API.

<a id="ERR_BROTLI_COMPRESSION_FAILED"></a>

### `ERR_BROTLI_COMPRESSION_FAILED`

Data passed to a Brotli stream was not successfully compressed.

<a id="ERR_BROTLI_INVALID_PARAM"></a>

### `ERR_BROTLI_INVALID_PARAM`

An invalid parameter key was passed during construction of a Brotli stream.

<a id="ERR_BUFFER_CONTEXT_NOT_AVAILABLE"></a>

### `ERR_BUFFER_CONTEXT_NOT_AVAILABLE`

An attempt was made to create a Node.js `Buffer` instance from addon or embedder
code, while in a JS engine Context that is not associated with a Node.js
instance. The data passed to the `Buffer` method will have been released
by the time the method returns.

When encountering this error, a possible alternative to creating a `Buffer`
instance is to create a normal `Uint8Array`, which only differs in the
prototype of the resulting object. `Uint8Array`s are generally accepted in all
Node.js core APIs where `Buffer`s are; they are available in all Contexts.

<a id="ERR_BUFFER_OUT_OF_BOUNDS"></a>

### `ERR_BUFFER_OUT_OF_BOUNDS`

An operation outside the bounds of a `Buffer` was attempted.

<a id="ERR_BUFFER_TOO_LARGE"></a>

### `ERR_BUFFER_TOO_LARGE`

An attempt has been made to create a `Buffer` larger than the maximum allowed
size.

<a id="ERR_CANNOT_WATCH_SIGINT"></a>

### `ERR_CANNOT_WATCH_SIGINT`

Node.js was unable to watch for the `SIGINT` signal.

<a id="ERR_CHILD_CLOSED_BEFORE_REPLY"></a>

### `ERR_CHILD_CLOSED_BEFORE_REPLY`

A child process was closed before the parent received a reply.

<a id="ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_IPC_REQUIRED"></a>

### `ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_IPC_REQUIRED`

Used when a child process is being forked without specifying an IPC channel.

<a id="ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_STDIO_MAXBUFFER"></a>

### `ERR_CHILD_PROCESS_STDIO_MAXBUFFER`

Used when the main process is trying to read data from the child process's
STDERR/STDOUT, and the data's length is longer than the `maxBuffer` option.

<a id="ERR_CLOSED_MESSAGE_PORT"></a>

### `ERR_CLOSED_MESSAGE_PORT`

<!-- YAML

-->

There was an attempt to use a `MessagePort` instance in a closed
state, usually after `.close()` has been called.

<a id="ERR_CONSOLE_WRITABLE_STREAM"></a>

### `ERR_CONSOLE_WRITABLE_STREAM`

`Console` was instantiated without `stdout` stream, or `Console` has a
non-writable `stdout` or `stderr` stream.

<a id="ERR_CONSTRUCT_CALL_INVALID"></a>

### `ERR_CONSTRUCT_CALL_INVALID`

<!-- YAML
added: v12.5.0
-->

A class constructor was called that is not callable.

<a id="ERR_CONSTRUCT_CALL_REQUIRED"></a>

### `ERR_CONSTRUCT_CALL_REQUIRED`

A constructor for a class was called without `new`.

<a id="ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_INITIALIZED"></a>

### `ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_INITIALIZED`

The vm context passed into the API is not yet initialized. This could happen
when an error occurs (and is caught) during the creation of the
context, for example, when the allocation fails or the maximum call stack
size is reached when the context is created.

<a id="ERR_CRYPTO_CUSTOM_ENGINE_NOT_SUPPORTED"></a>

### `ERR_CRYPTO_CUSTOM_ENGINE_NOT_SUPPORTED`

An OpenSSL engine was requested (for example, through the `clientCertEngine` or
`privateKeyEngine` TLS options) that is not supported by the version of OpenSSL
being used, likely due to the compile-time flag `OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE`.

<a id="ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE"></a>

### `ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`

> Stability: 1 - Experimental

When trying to `require()` a [ES Module][], the module turns out to be asynchronous.
That is, it contains top-level await.

To see where the top-level await is, use
`--experimental-print-required-tla` (this would execute the modules
before looking for the top-level awaits).

<a id="ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE"></a>

### `ERR_REQUIRE_CYCLE_MODULE`

> Stability: 1 - Experimental

When trying to `require()` a [ES Module][], a CommonJS to ESM or ESM to CommonJS edge
participates in an immediate cycle.
This is not allowed because ES Modules cannot be evaluated while they are
already being evaluated.

To avoid the cycle, the `require()` call involved in a cycle should not happen
at the top-level of either an ES Module (via `createRequire()`) or a CommonJS
module, and should be done lazily in an inner function.

<a id="ERR_REQUIRE_ESM"></a>

### `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM`

  - version:
    - v23.0.0
    - v22.12.0
    pr-url: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/55085
    description: require() now supports loading synchronous ES modules by default.
-->

> Stability: 0 - Deprecated

An attempt was made to `require()` an [ES Module][].

This error has been deprecated since `require()` now supports loading synchronous
ES modules. When `require()` encounters an ES module that contains top-level
`await`, it will throw [`ERR_REQUIRE_ASYNC_MODULE`][] instead.

list of ALPN protocols offered by the client.

<a id="ERR_TLS_ALPN_CALLBACK_WITH_PROTOCOLS"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_ALPN_CALLBACK_WITH_PROTOCOLS`

This error is thrown when creating a `TLSServer` if the TLS options include
both `ALPNProtocols` and `ALPNCallback`. These options are mutually exclusive.

<a id="ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_FORMAT"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_FORMAT`

This error is thrown by `checkServerIdentity` if a user-supplied
`subjectaltname` property violates encoding rules. Certificate objects produced
by Node.js itself always comply with encoding rules and will never cause
this error.

<a id="ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_CERT_ALTNAME_INVALID`

While using TLS, the host name/IP of the peer did not match any of the
`subjectAltNames` in its certificate.

<a id="ERR_TLS_DH_PARAM_SIZE"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_DH_PARAM_SIZE`

While using TLS, the parameter offered for the Diffie-Hellman (`DH`)
key-agreement protocol is too small. By default, the key length must be greater
than or equal to 1024 bits to avoid vulnerabilities, even though it is strongly
recommended to use 2048 bits or larger for stronger security.

<a id="ERR_TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`

An attempt was made to renegotiate TLS on a socket instance with renegotiation
disabled.

<a id="ERR_TLS_REQUIRED_SERVER_NAME"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_REQUIRED_SERVER_NAME`

While using TLS, the `server.addContext()` method was called without providing
a host name in the first parameter.

<a id="ERR_TLS_SESSION_ATTACK"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_SESSION_ATTACK`

An excessive amount of TLS renegotiations is detected, which is a potential
vector for denial-of-service attacks.

<a id="ERR_TLS_SNI_FROM_SERVER"></a>

### `ERR_TLS_SNI_FROM_SERVER`

An attempt was made to issue Server Name Indication from a TLS server-side
socket, which is only valid from a client.

    description: Max header size in `http_parser` was set to 8 KiB.
-->

Too much HTTP header data was received. In order to protect against malicious or
malconfigured clients, if more than `maxHeaderSize` of HTTP header data is received then
HTTP parsing will abort without a request or response object being created, and
an `Error` with this code will be emitted.

<a id="HPE_UNEXPECTED_CONTENT_LENGTH"></a>

### `HPE_UNEXPECTED_CONTENT_LENGTH`

Server is sending both a `Content-Length` header and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.

`Transfer-Encoding: chunked` allows the server to maintain an HTTP persistent
connection for dynamically generated content.
In this case, the `Content-Length` HTTP header cannot be used.

Use `Content-Length` or `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.

<a id="MODULE_NOT_FOUND"></a>

removed: v12.12.0
-->

The UTF-16 encoding was used with [`hash.digest()`][]. While the
`hash.digest()` method does allow an `encoding` argument to be passed in,
causing the method to return a string rather than a `Buffer`, the UTF-16
encoding (e.g. `ucs` or `utf16le`) is not supported.

<a id="ERR_CRYPTO_SCRYPT_INVALID_PARAMETER"></a>

### `ERR_CRYPTO_SCRYPT_INVALID_PARAMETER`

<!-- YAML
removed: v23.0.0

An object that needs to be explicitly listed in the `transferList` argument
is in the object passed to a [`postMessage()`][] call, but is not provided
in the `transferList` for that call. Usually, this is a `MessagePort`.

In Node.js versions prior to v15.0.0, the error code being used here was
[`ERR_MISSING_MESSAGE_PORT_IN_TRANSFER_LIST`][]. However, the set of
transferable object types has been expanded to cover more types than
`MessagePort`.

<a id="Time Validity Errors"></a>

### Time Validity Errors

<a id="CERT_NOT_YET_VALID"></a>

#### `CERT_NOT_YET_VALID`

The certificate is not yet valid: the notBefore date is after the current time.

<a id="CERT_HAS_EXPIRED"></a>

#### `CERT_HAS_EXPIRED`

The certificate has expired: the notAfter date is before the current time.

<a id="CRL_NOT_YET_VALID"></a>

#### `CRL_NOT_YET_VALID`

The certificate revocation list (CRL) has a future issue date.

<a id="CRL_HAS_EXPIRED"></a>

#### `CRL_HAS_EXPIRED`

<a id="Trust or Chain Related Errors"></a>

### Trust or Chain Related Errors

<a id="UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT"></a>

#### `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT`

The issuer certificate of a looked up certificate could not be found. This
normally means the list of trusted certificates is not complete.

<a id="UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY"></a>

#### `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`

The certificate’s issuer is not known. This is the case if the issuer is not
included in the trusted certificate list.

<a id="DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT"></a>

#### `DEPTH_ZERO_SELF_SIGNED_CERT`

The passed certificate is self-signed and the same certificate cannot be found
in the list of trusted certificates.

<a id="SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN"></a>

#### `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`

The certificate’s issuer is not known. This is the case if the issuer is not
included in the trusted certificate list.

<a id="CERT_CHAIN_TOO_LONG"></a>

#### `CERT_CHAIN_TOO_LONG`

The certificate chain length is greater than the maximum depth.

<a id="UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL"></a>

#### `UNABLE_TO_GET_CRL`

The CRL reference by the certificate could not be found.

<a id="UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE"></a>

#### `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`

No signatures could be verified because the chain contains only one certificate
and it is not self signed.

<a id="CERT_UNTRUSTED"></a>

#### `CERT_UNTRUSTED`

The root certificate authority (CA) is not marked as trusted for the specified
purpose.

<a id="Basic Extension Errors"></a>

### Basic Extension Errors

<a id="INVALID_CA"></a>

#### `INVALID_CA`

A CA certificate is invalid. Either it is not a CA or its extensions are not
consistent with the supplied purpose.

<a id="PATH_LENGTH_EXCEEDED"></a>

#### `PATH_LENGTH_EXCEEDED`

<a id="CERT_REJECTED"></a>

#### `CERT_REJECTED`

The root CA is marked to reject the specified purpose.

<a id="Formatting Errors"></a>

### Formatting Errors

<a id="CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE"></a>

#### `CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE`

The signature of the certificate is invalid.

<a id="CRL_SIGNATURE_FAILURE"></a>

#### `CRL_SIGNATURE_FAILURE`

The signature of the certificate revocation list (CRL) is invalid.

<a id="ERROR_IN_CERT_NOT_BEFORE_FIELD"></a>

#### `ERROR_IN_CRL_NEXT_UPDATE_FIELD`

The CRL nextUpdate field contains an invalid time.

<a id="UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CERT_SIGNATURE"></a>

#### `UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CERT_SIGNATURE`

The certificate signature could not be decrypted. This means that the actual
signature value could not be determined rather than it not matching the expected
value, this is only meaningful for RSA keys.

<a id="UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CRL_SIGNATURE"></a>

#### `UNABLE_TO_DECRYPT_CRL_SIGNATURE`

The certificate revocation list (CRL) signature could not be decrypted: this
means that the actual signature value could not be determined rather than it not
matching the expected value.
