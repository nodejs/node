# Investigating memory leaks with Valgrind

A Node.js process may run out of memory due to excessive consumption of
native memory. Native Memory is memory which is not managed by the
V8 Garbage collector and is allocated either by the Node.js runtime, its
dependencies or native [addons](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/n-api.html).

This guide provides information on how to use Valgrind to investigate these
issues on Linux platforms.

## Valgrind

[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html) is a
tool available on Linux distributions which can be used to investigate
memory usage including identifying memory leaks (memory which is
allocated and not freed) and other memory related problems
like double freeing memory.

To use Valgrind:

* Be patient, running under Valgrind slows execution significantly
  due to the checks being performed.
* Reduce your test case to the smallest reproduce. Due to the slowdown it is
  important to run the minimum test case in order to be able to do it in
  a reasonable time.

## Installation

It is an optional package in most cases and must be installed explicitly.
For example on Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
apt-get install valgrind
```

## Invocation

The simplest invocation of Valgrind is:

```bash
valgrind node test.js
```

with the output being:

```console

This reports that Node.js is not _completely_ clean as there is some memory
that was allocated but not freed when the process shut down. It is often
impractical/not worth being completely clean in this respect. Modern
operating systems will clean up the memory of the process after the
shutdown while attempting to free all memory to get a clean
report may have a negative impact on the code complexity and
shutdown times. Node.js does a pretty good job only leaving on
the order of 6 KB that are not freed on shutdown.

## An obvious memory leak

Leaks can be introduced in native addons and the following is a simple
example leak based on the "Hello world" addon from
[node-addon-examples](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples).

In this example, a loop which allocates approximately 1 MiB of memory and never
frees it has been added:

```cpp
void* malloc_holder = nullptr;
napi_value Method(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info) {
  napi_status status;
  napi_value world;
  status = napi_create_string_utf8(env, "world", 5, &world);
  assert(status == napi_ok);

  // NEW LEAK HERE
  for (int i=0; i < 1024; i++) {
    malloc_holder = malloc(1024);
  }

  return world;
}
```

When trying to create a memory leak you need to ensure that
the compiler has not optimized out the code that creates
the leak. For example, by assigning the result of the allocation
to either a global variable or a variable that will be read
afterwards the compiler will not optimize it out along with
the malloc and Valgrind will properly report the memory leak.
If `malloc_holder` in the example above is made into a
local variable then the compiler may freely remove
it along with the allocations (since it is not used)
and Valgrind will not find any leaks since they
will no longer exist in the code being run.

Running Valgrind on this code shows the following:

Valgrind is reporting a problem as it shows 996,604 bytes as
definitely lost and the question is how to find where that memory was
allocated. The next step is to rerun as suggested in the
output with `--leak-check=full`:

This is the most interesting part of the report:

```

From the stack trace we can tell that the leak came from a native addon:

```console
==4174==    by 0x9794979: Method(napi_env__*, napi_callback_info__*) (in /home/user1/valgrind/node-addon-examples/1_hello_world/napi/build/Release/hello.node)
```

What we can't tell is where in the native addon the memory is being
allocated. This is because by default the addon is compiled without
the debug symbols which Valgrind needs to be able to provide more
information.

It is possible to hide leaks related to Node.js itself in future Valgrind runs
using the suppression feature of Valgrind.

## Generating a Valgrind suppression file

Valgrind uses suppression files to hide issues found from the summary. Generate
a log file with embedded suppressions using the `--gen-suppressions` and
`--log-file` flags:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full \
   --gen-suppressions=all \
   --log-file=./valgrind-out.txt \
   node hello.js
```

Valgrind will save the output to the log file specified. After each heap in the
summary, Valgrind will include a suppression record: a structure that Valgrind
can use to ignore specific memory issues. Suppression records can be saved to a
suppression file which Valgrind can use in subsequent executions to hide various
memory errors. This is an example of the suppression records from the previous
call:

```text

```

Create a file (eg. `node-12.14.1.supp`) with the contents of the suppression
records, and run Valgrind with the suppression file previously created:

```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full \
   --suppressions=./node-12.14.1.supp \
   node hello.js
```

Now, the Valgrind leak summary for suppressed issues are only mentioned as
`suppressed` in the leak summary:

```console

==12471==         suppressed: 368 bytes in 2 blocks
```

## Enabling debug symbols to get more information

Leaks may be either in addons or Node.js itself. The sections which
follow cover the steps needed to enable debug symbols to get more info.

### Native addons

To enable debug symbols for all of your addons that are compiled on
install use:

```bash
npm install --debug
```

Any options which are not consumed by npm are passed on to node-gyp and this
results in the addons being compiled with the debug option.

If the native addon contains pre-built binaries you will need to force
a rebuild.

```bash
npm install --debug
npm rebuild
```

The next step is to run Valgrind after the rebuild. This time the information
for the leaking location includes the name of the source file and the
line number:

```console
==18481== 997,000 bytes in 997 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 35 of 35

==18481==    by 0x12F68A3: ??? (in /home/user1/valgrind/node-v12.14.1-linux-x64/bin/node)
```

This new output shows us exactly where the leak is occurring in the file `hello.cc`:

```cpp
  6 void* malloc_holder = nullptr;
  7 napi_value Method(napi_env env, napi_callback_info info) {
  8   napi_status status;
  9   napi_value world;
 10   status = napi_create_string_utf8(env, "world", 5, &world);
 11   assert(status == napi_ok);
 12   for (int i=0; i< 1000; i++) {
 13     malloc_holder = malloc(1000);  // <<<<<< This is where we are allocating the memory that is not freed
 14   }
 15   return world;
 16 }
```

### Node.js binary

If the leak is not in an addon and is instead in the Node.js binary itself,
you may need to compile node yourself and turn on debug symbols. Looking at
this entry reported by Valgrind, with a release binary we see:

```console
 ==4174== 304 bytes in 1 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 27 of 35
==4174==    at 0x4C31B25: calloc (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)
==4174==    by 0x40134A6: allocate_dtv (dl-tls.c:286)
==4174==    by 0x40134A6: _dl_allocate_tls (dl-tls.c:530)
==4174==    by 0x5987227: allocate_stack (allocatestack.c:627)
==4174==    by 0x5987227: pthread_create@@GLIBC_2.2.5 (pthread_create.c:644)
==4174==    by 0xAAF9DC: node::inspector::Agent::Start(std::string const&, node::DebugOptions const&, std::shared_ptr<node::HostPort>, bool) (in /home/user1/valgrind/node-v12.14.1-linux-x64/bin/node)
==4174==    by 0x9A8BE7: node::Environment::InitializeInspector(std::unique_ptr<node::inspector::ParentInspectorHandle, std::default_delete<node::inspector::ParentInspectorHandle> >) (in /home/user1/valgrind/node-v12.14.1-linux-x64/bin/node)
==4174==    by 0xA1C9A5: node::NodeMainInstance::CreateMainEnvironment(int*) (in /home/user1/valgrind/node-v12.14.1-linux-x64/bin/node)
==4174==    by 0xA1CB42: node::NodeMainInstance::Run() (in /home/user1/valgrind/node-v12.14.1-linux-x64/bin/node)
==4174==    by 0x9ACB67: node::Start(int, char**) (in /home/user1/valgrind/node-v12.14.1-linux-x64/bin/node)
==4174==    by 0x5BBFB96: (below main) (libc-start.c:310)
```

This gives us some information of where to look (`node::inspector::Agent::Start`)
but not where in that function. We get more information than you might expect
(or see by default with addons) because the Node.js binary exports many of
its symbols using `-rdynamic` so that they can be used by addons. If the stack
gives you enough information to track down where the leak is, that's great,
otherwise the next step is to compile a debug build of Node.js.

To get additional information with Valgrind:

* Check out the Node.js source corresponding to the release that you
  want to debug. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nodejs/node.git
git checkout v12.14.1
```

* Compile with debug enabled (for additional info see
  [building a debug build](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v12.14.1/BUILDING.md#building-a-debug-build)).
  For example, on \*nix:

```bash
./configure --debug
make -j4
```

* Make sure to run with your compiled debug version of Node.js. Having used
  `./configure --debug`, two binaries will have been built when `make` was run.
  You must use the one which is in `out/Debug`.

Running Valgrind using the debug build of Node.js shows:

```console
==44112== 592 bytes in 1 blocks are possibly lost in loss record 26 of 27
==44112==    at 0x4C2BF79: calloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:762)
==44112==    by 0x4012754: _dl_allocate_tls (in /usr/lib64/ld-2.17.so)
==44112==    by 0x586287B: pthread_create@@GLIBC_2.2.5 (in /usr/lib64/libpthread-2.17.so)
==44112==    by 0xFAB2D2: node::inspector::(anonymous namespace)::StartDebugSignalHandler() (inspector_agent.cc:140)
==44112==    by 0xFACB10: node::inspector::Agent::Start(std::string const&, node::DebugOptions const&, std::shared_ptr<node::HostPort>, bool) (inspector_agent.cc:777)
==44112==    by 0xE3A0BB: node::Environment::InitializeInspector(std::unique_ptr<node::inspector::ParentInspectorHandle, std::default_delete<node::inspector::ParentInspectorHandle> >) (node.cc:216)
==44112==    by 0xEE8F3E: node::NodeMainInstance::CreateMainEnvironment(int*) (node_main_instance.cc:222)
==44112==    by 0xEE8831: node::NodeMainInstance::Run() (node_main_instance.cc:108)
==44112==    by 0xE3CDEC: node::Start(int, char**) (node.cc:996)
==44112==    by 0x22D8BBF: main (node_main.cc:126)
```

Now we can see the specific file name and line in the Node.js code which
caused the allocation (inspector\_agent.cc:140).

We can examine that line (and its surrounding code) to
find a solution for the memory leak.
