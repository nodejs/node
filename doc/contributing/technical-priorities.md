# Technical Priorities

This list represents the current view of key technical priorities recognized
by the project as important to ensure the ongoing success of Node.js.
It is based on an understanding of the Node.js
[constituencies](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/blob/main/CONSTITUENCIES.md)
and their [needs](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/blob/main/CONSTITUENCY-NEEDS.md).

The initial version was created based on the work of the
[Next-10 team](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10) and the
[mini-summit](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/76)
on August 5th 2021.

They will be updated regularly and will be reviewed by the next-10 team
and the TSC on a 6-month basis.

Version from the [mini-summit](https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/1)
on October 1st 2022.

## Modern HTTP

_Present in: 2021_

Base HTTP support is a key component of modern cloud-native applications
and built-in support was part of what made Node.js a success in the first
10 years. The current implementation is hard to support and a common
source of vulnerabilities. We must work towards an
implementation which is easier to support and makes it easier to integrate
the new HTTP versions (HTTP3, QUIC) and to support efficient
implementations of different versions concurrently.

## Suitable types for end-users

_Present in: 2021_

Using typings with JavaScript can allow a richer experience when using Visual
Studio Code (or any other IDEs) environments, more complete documentation
of APIs and the ability to identify and resolve errors earlier in the
development process. These benefits are important to a large number of Node.js
developers (maybe 50%).  Further typing support may be important
to enterprises that are considering expanding their preferred platforms to
include Node.js. It is, therefore, important that the Node.js project work
to ensure there are good typings available for the public Node.js APIs.

## Documentation

_Present in: 2021_

The current documentation is great for experienced developers or people
who are aware of what they are looking for. On the other hand, for
beginners this documentation can be quite hard to read and finding the
desired information is difficult. We must have documentation
that is suitable for beginners to continue the rapid growth in use.
This documentation should include more concrete examples and a learning
path for newcomers.

## WebAssembly

_Present in: 2021_

The use of WebAssembly has been growing over the last few years.
To ensure Node.js continues to be part of solutions where a
subset of the solution needs the performance that WebAssembly can
deliver, Node.js must provide good support for running
WebAssembly components along with the JavaScript that makes up the rest
of the solution. This includes implementations of “host” APIs like WASI.

## ES Modules (ESM)

_Present in: 2021_

The CommonJS module system was one of the key components that led to the
success of Node.js in its first 10 years. ESM is the standard that has
been adopted as the equivalent in the broader JavaScript ecosystem and
Node.js must continue to develop and improve its ESM implementation
to stay relevant and ensure continued growth for the next 10 years.

## Support for features from the latest ECMAScript spec

JavaScript developers are a fast moving group and need/want support for new ES
JavaScript features in a timely manner. Node.js must continue
to provide support for up to date ES versions to remain the runtime
of choice and to ensure its continued growth for the next 10 years.

## Observability

_Present in: 2021_

The ability to investigate and resolve problems that occur in applications
running in production is crucial for organizations. Tools that allow
people to observe the current and past operation of the application are
needed to support that need. It is therefore important that the Node.js
project work towards well understood and defined processes for observing
the behavior of Node.js applications as well as ensuring there are well
supported tools to implement those processes (logging, metrics and tracing).
This includes support within the Node.js runtime itself (for example
generating heap dumps, performance metrics, etc.) as well as support for
applications on top of the runtime. In addition, it is also important to
clearly document the use cases, problem determination methods and best
practices for those tools.

## Better multithreaded support

_Present in: 2021_

Today's servers support multiple threads of concurrent execution.
Node.js deployments must be able to make full and efficient
use of the available resources. The right answer is often to use
technologies like containers to run multiple single threaded Node.js
instances on the same server. However, there are important use cases
where a single Node.js instance needs to make use of multiple threads
to achieve a performant and efficient implementation. In addition,
even when a Node.js instance only needs to consume a single thread to
complete its work there can be issues. If that work is long running,
blocking the event loop will interfere with other supporting work like
metrics gathering and health checks. Node.js
must provide good support for using multiple threads
to ensure the continued growth and success of Node.js.

## Single Executable Applications

Node.js often loses out to other runtimes/languages in cases where
being able to package a single, executable application simplifies
distribution and management of what needs to be delivered. While there are
components/approaches for doing this, they need to be better
documented and evangelized so that this is not seen as a barrier
for using Node.js in these situations. This is important to support
the expansion of where/when Node.js is used in building solutions.

## Serverless

Serverless is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the
underlyinginfrastructure and automatically allocates resources as
needed. Developers only need to focus on writing code for specific
functions, which are executed as individual units of work in response to
events. Node.js is one of the main technology used by developers in
this field therefore it is crucial for us to provide a great solution.

## Small footprint

Small software footprints refer to software that has a minimal impact on
system resources such as memory and processing power. This can be achieved
through various methods such as optimizing code, reducing the number of
dependencies, or using lightweight frameworks. Smaller footprints can lead
to faster startup times, reduced memory usage, and improved overall system
performance. This is fundamental for Node.js to be a lightweight proposition
inside the ecosystem as it is used across a wild variety of projects, from
web application to IoT and serverless.

## Developers-first DX

Developer experience (DX) refers to the overall experience a developer has when
working with a software development platform, framework, or tool. It encompasses
all aspects of the developer's interactions with the system, from installation
and configuration to writing code and debugging. A good DX prioritizes ease
of use, efficiency, and productivity, and can lead to faster development times,
higher quality code, and greater developer satisfaction. Factors that can
impact DX include documentation, community support, testing tools,
and integration with other systems.
As TypeScript usage continues to grow and gains more prominence in the
ecosystem, enhancing its support is essential for delivering an improved
developer experience for newcomers and experienced users alike.

## Package management

The ability to easily install and manage dependencies and development tools is a
key part of the user experience, and for that reason Node.js must provide a
package manager as part of its distribution. Node.js includes `npm` for this
purpose. This is for historical reasons — when `npm` was added in 2011, it was
the only JavaScript package manager — and because it is the reference
implementation for the npm registry, which is the de facto primary source for
most JavaScript software. In accordance with our [policy][distribution-policy]
of not including multiple dependencies or tools that serve the same purpose, the
Node.js project does not include any other package managers; though it may
include other software to download other package managers.
