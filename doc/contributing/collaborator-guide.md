This document explains how collaborators manage the Node.js project.
Collaborators should understand the
[guidelines for new contributors](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[project governance model](../../GOVERNANCE.md).

## Issues and pull requests

Mind these guidelines, the opinions of other collaborators, and guidance of the
[TSC][]. Notify other qualified parties for more input on an issue or a pull
request. See [Who to CC in the issue tracker](#who-to-cc-in-the-issue-tracker).

### Welcoming first-time contributors

Always show courtesy to individuals submitting issues and pull requests. Be
welcoming to first-time contributors, identified by the GitHub **First-time contributor** badge.

For first-time contributors, check if the commit author is the same as the pull
request author. This way, once their pull request lands, GitHub will show them
as a _Contributor_. Ask if they have configured their git
[username][git-username] and [email][git-email] to their liking.

### Closing issues and pull requests

Collaborators can close any issue or pull request that is not relevant to the
future of the Node.js project. Where this is unclear, leave the issue or pull
request open for several days to allow for discussion. Where this does not yield
evidence that the issue or pull request has relevance, close it. Remember that
issues and pull requests can always be re-opened if necessary.

### Author ready pull requests

A pull request is _author ready_ when:

* There is a CI run in progress or completed.
* There is at least one collaborator approval.
* There are no outstanding review comments.

Please always add the `author ready` label to the pull request in that case.
Please always remove it again as soon as the conditions are not met anymore.

### Handling own pull requests

When you open a pull request, [start a CI](#testing-and-ci) right away. Later,
after new code changes or rebasing, start a new CI.

As soon as the pull request is ready to land, please do so. This allows other
collaborators to focus on other pull requests. If your pull request is not ready
to land but is [author ready](#author-ready-pull-requests), add the
`author ready` label. If you wish to land the pull request yourself, use the
"assign yourself" link to self-assign it.

### Managing security issues

Use the process outlined in [SECURITY.md][] to report security
issues. If a user opens a security issue in the public repository:

* Ask the user to submit a report through HackerOne as outlined in
  [SECURITY.md][].
* Move the issue to the private repository called
  [premature-disclosures](https://github.com/nodejs/premature-disclosures).
* For any related pull requests, create an associated issue in the
  `premature-disclosures` repository.  Add a copy of the patch for the
  pull request to the issue. Add screenshots of discussion from the pull request
  to the issue.
* [Open a ticket with GitHub](https://support.github.com/contact) to delete the
  pull request using Node.js (team) as the account organization.
* Open a new issue in the public repository with the title `FYI - pull request
  deleted #YYYY`. Include an explanation for the user:
  > FYI @xxxx we asked GitHub to delete your pull request while we work on
  > releases in private.
* Email `tsc@iojs.org` with links to the issues in the
  `premature-disclosures` repository.

## Accepting modifications

Contributors propose modifications to Node.js using GitHub pull requests. This
includes modifications proposed by TSC members and other collaborators. A pull
request must pass code review and CI before landing into the codebase.

### Code reviews

At least two collaborators must approve a pull request before the pull request
lands. One collaborator approval is enough if the pull request has been open
for more than seven days.

Approving a pull request indicates that the collaborator accepts responsibility
for the change.

Approval must be from collaborators who are not authors of the change.

Ideally pull requests for dependencies should be generated by automation.
Pay special attention to pull requests for dependencies which have not
been automatically generated and follow the guidance in
[Maintaining Dependencies](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/contributing/maintaining/maintaining-dependencies.md#updating-dependencies).

In some cases, it might be necessary to summon a GitHub team to a pull request
for review by @-mention.
See [Who to CC in the issue tracker](#who-to-cc-in-the-issue-tracker).

If you are the first collaborator to approve a pull request that has no CI yet,
please [start one](#testing-and-ci). Please also start a new CI if the
pull request creator pushed new code since the last CI run.

### Consensus seeking

A pull request can land if it has the needed [approvals](#code-reviews),
[CI](#testing-and-ci), [wait time](#waiting-for-approvals) and no
[outstanding objections](#objections). [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes)
must receive [TSC review](#involving-the-tsc) in addition to other
requirements. If a pull request meets all requirements except the
[wait time](#waiting-for-approvals), please add the
[`author ready`](#author-ready-pull-requests) label.

#### Objections

Collaborators can object to a pull request by using the "Request
Changes" GitHub feature. Dissent comments alone don't constitute an
objection, nor do dissenting comments made in any associated issue.
A blocking objection to a change must be made in the pull request that
specifically proposes that change. Any pull request objection must include
a clear reason for that objection, and the objector must remain responsive
for further discussion towards consensus about the direction of the pull
request. Where possible, provide a set of actionable steps alongside the
objection.

If the objection is not clear to others, another collaborator can ask an
objecting collaborator to explain their objection or to provide actionable
steps to resolve the objection. If the objector is unresponsive for seven
days after a collaborator asks for clarification, a collaborator may
dismiss the objection.

Pull requests with outstanding objections must remain open until all
objections are satisfied. If reaching consensus is not possible, a
collaborator can escalate the issue to the TSC by pinging `@nodejs/tsc` and
adding the `tsc-agenda` label to the issue. The change cannot proceed without
either reaching consensus or a TSC decision to dismiss the objection(s). If the
TSC does choose to dismiss any objections, a clear explanation of the reasoning
must be given in the pull request before it lands.

All Collaborator objections are considered equal. There is no greater weight given to
objections from TSC members than from any other Collaborator.

Mistakes do happen from time-to-time. If a pull request is merged with an
outstanding objection, corrective action should be taken. Any Collaborator
can open a pull request that either reverts the change or makes an additional
follow-up change that addresses the objection. Such corrections will typically
be subject to fast-tracking. An automatic, immediate revert is not always
necessary or ideal.

Collaborators objecting to a pull request can best ensure their objections
are addressed by remaining actively engaged and responsive in the discussion.

* [Code Review Etiquette](https://css-tricks.com/code-review-etiquette/)

### Waiting for approvals

Before landing pull requests, allow 48 hours for input from other collaborators.
Certain types of pull requests can be fast-tracked and can land after a shorter
delay. For example:

* Focused changes that affect only documentation and/or the test suite:
  * `code-and-learn` tasks often fall into this category.
  * `good-first-issue` pull requests might also be suitable.
* Changes that fix regressions:
  * Regressions that break the workflow (red CI or broken compilation).
  * Regressions that happen right before a release, or reported soon after.

To propose fast-tracking a pull request, apply the `fast-track` label. Then a
GitHub Actions workflow will add a comment that collaborators can upvote.

If someone disagrees with the fast-tracking request, remove the label. Do not
fast-track the pull request in that case.

The pull request can be fast-tracked if two collaborators approve the
fast-tracking request. To land, the pull request itself still needs two
collaborator approvals and a passing CI.

Collaborators can request fast-tracking of pull requests they did not author.
In that case only, the request itself is also one fast-track approval. Upvote
the comment anyway to avoid any doubt.

### Testing and CI

All fixes must have a test case which demonstrates the defect. The test should
fail before the change, and pass after the change.

Do not land any pull requests without the necessary passing CI runs.
A passing (green) GitHub Actions CI result is required. A passing (green or
yellow) [Jenkins CI](https://ci.nodejs.org/) is also required if the pull
request contains changes that will affect the `node` binary. This is because
GitHub Actions CI does not cover all the environments supported by Node.js.

<details>
<summary>Changes that affect the `node` binary</summary>

Changes in the following folders (except comment-only changes) are guaranteed to
affect the `node` binary:

* `deps/`
* `lib/`
* `src/`
* `test/`
* `tools/code_cache/`
* `tools/gyp/`
* `tools/icu/`
* `tools/inspector-protocol/`
* `tools/msvs/`
* `tools/snapshot/`
* `tools/v8_gypfiles/`

There are some other files that touch the build chain. Changes in the following
files also qualify as affecting the `node` binary:

* `tools/*.py`
* `*.gyp`
* `*.gypi`
* `configure`
* `configure.py`
* `Makefile`
* `vcbuild.bat`

</details>

If there are GitHub Actions CI failures unrelated to the change in the pull
request, try the "🔄 Re-run all jobs" button, on the right-hand side of the
"Checks" tab.

If there are Jenkins CI failures unrelated to the change in the pull request,
try "Resume Build". It is in the left navigation of the relevant
`node-test-pull-request` job. It will preserve all the green results from the
current job but re-run everything else. Start a fresh CI by pressing "Retry"
if more than seven days have elapsed since the original failing CI as the
compiled binaries for the Windows and ARM platforms are only kept for seven days.

If new commits are pushed to the pull request branch after the latest Jenkins
CI run, a fresh CI run is required. It can be started by adding the `request-ci`
label to the pull request.

#### Useful Jenkins CI jobs

* [`node-test-pull-request`](https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-pull-request/)
  is the CI job to test pull requests. It runs the `build-ci` and `test-ci`
  targets on all supported platforms.

* [`citgm-smoker`](https://ci.nodejs.org/job/citgm-smoker/)
  uses [`CitGM`](https://github.com/nodejs/citgm) to allow you to run
  `npm install && npm test` on a large selection of common modules. This is
  useful to check whether a change will cause breakage in the ecosystem.

* [`node-stress-single-test`](https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-stress-single-test/)
  can run a group of tests over and over on a specific platform. Use it to check
  that the tests are reliable.

* [`node-test-commit-v8-linux`](https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-commit-v8-linux/)
  runs the standard V8 tests. Run it when updating V8 in Node.js or floating new
  patches on V8.

* [`node-test-commit-custom-suites-freestyle`](https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-commit-custom-suites-freestyle/)
  enables customization of test suites and parameters. It can execute test
  suites not used in other CI test runs (such as tests in the `internet` or
  `pummel` directories). It can also make sure tests pass when provided with a
  flag not used in other CI test runs (such as `--worker`).

#### Starting a Jenkins CI job

From the CI Job page, click "Build with Parameters" on the left side.

You generally need to enter only one or both of the following options
in the form:

* `GIT_REMOTE_REF`: Change to the remote portion of git refspec.
  To specify the branch this way, `refs/heads/BRANCH` is used
  (e.g. for `main` -> `refs/heads/main`).
  For pull requests, it will look like `refs/pull/PR_NUMBER/head`
  (e.g. for pull request #42 -> `refs/pull/42/head`).
* `REBASE_ONTO`: Change that to `origin/main` so the pull request gets rebased
  onto `main`. This can especially be important for pull requests that have been
  open a while.

Look at the list of jobs on the left hand side under "Build History" and copy
the link to the one you started (which will be the one on top, but click
through to make sure it says something like "Started 5 seconds ago"
(top right) and "Started by user ...".

Copy/paste the URL for the job into a comment in the pull request.
[`node-test-pull-request`](https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-pull-request/)
is an exception where the GitHub bot will automatically post for you.

The [`node-test-pull-request`](https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-pull-request/)
CI job can be started by adding the `request-ci` label into the pull request.
Once this label is added, `github-actions bot` will start
the `node-test-pull-request` automatically. If the `github-actions bot`
is unable to start the job, it will update the label with `request-ci-failed`.

### Internal vs. public API

All functionality in the official Node.js documentation is part of the public
API. Any undocumented object, property, method, argument, behavior, or event is
internal. There are exceptions to this rule. Node.js users have come to rely on
some undocumented behaviors. Collaborators treat many of those undocumented
behaviors as public.

All undocumented functionality exposed via  `process.binding(...)` is internal.

All undocumented functionality in `lib/internal/**/*.js` is internal. It is
public, though, if it is re-exported by code in `lib/*.js`.

Non-exported `Symbol` properties and methods are internal.

Any undocumented object property or method that begins with `_` is internal.

Any native C/C++ APIs/ABIs requiring the `NODE_WANT_INTERNALS` flag are
internal.

Sometimes, there is disagreement about whether functionality is internal or
public. In those cases, the TSC makes a determination.

For undocumented APIs that are public, open a pull request documenting the API.

### Breaking changes

At least two TSC voting members must approve backward-incompatible changes to
the `main` branch.

Examples of breaking changes include:

* Removal or redefinition of existing API arguments.
* Changing return values.
* Removing or modifying existing properties on an options argument.
* Adding or removing errors.
* Altering expected timing of an event.
* Changing the side effects of using a particular API.

#### Breaking changes and deprecations

Existing stable public APIs that change in a backward-incompatible way must
undergo deprecation. The exceptions to this rule are:

* Adding or removing errors thrown or reported by a public API.
* Emitting a runtime warning.
* Changing error messages for errors without error code.
* Altering the timing and non-internal side effects of the public API.
* Changes to errors thrown by dependencies of Node.js, such as V8.
* One-time exceptions granted by the TSC.

For more information, see [Deprecations](#deprecations).

#### Breaking changes to internal elements

Breaking changes to internal elements can occur in semver-patch or semver-minor
commits. Take significant care when making and reviewing such changes. Make
an effort to determine the potential impact of the change in the ecosystem. Use
[Canary in the Goldmine](https://github.com/nodejs/citgm) to test such changes.
If a change will cause ecosystem breakage, then it is semver-major. Consider
providing a Public API in such cases.

#### Unintended breaking changes

Sometimes, a change intended to be non-breaking turns out to be a breaking
change. If such a change lands on the `main` branch, a collaborator can revert
it. As an alternative to reverting, the TSC can apply the semver-major label
after-the-fact.

If the change has already been backported to release lines open
an issue in the TSC repository to discuss how best to proceed. In the past
we have often reverted in the release lines and kept the change on main. The
decision to revert or not most often is based on limiting the impact
to the ecosystem and how quickly the breaking change is discovered.

If the change is reverted make sure to:

* consider if additional tests can be added to avoid a similar breaking change
  being missed in the future.
* consider if adding packages to CITGM would have helped catch
  the breaking change.
* ensure the changelog with the revert clearly explains the situation and
  it's impact on those who may have already used the updated API.

In either case make sure that the documentation and changelog for the
original breaking change are updated to reflect the breaking behavior.

##### Reverting commits

Revert commits with `git revert <HASH>` or `git revert <FROM>..<TO>`. The
generated commit message will not have a subsystem and might violate line length
rules. That is OK. Append the reason for the revert and any `Refs` or `Fixes`
metadata. Raise a pull request like any other change.

### Introducing new modules

Treat commits that introduce new core modules with extra care.

New modules must only be added with the `node:` prefix.

When adding promises to an existing API, add `/promises`
(`inspector/promises`, etc.). Apply the `semver-major` label to the addition.

If the new module name is free in npm, register
a placeholder in the module registry as soon as possible. Link to the pull
request that introduces the new core module in the placeholder's `README`.

If the module name is not free and the module is
not widely used, contact the owner to see if they would be willing to transfer
it to the project.

We register a placeholder without the `node:` prefix whenever
possible to avoid confusion and typosquatting attacks.

For pull requests introducing new core modules:

* Allow at least one week for review.
* Land only after sign-off from at least two TSC voting members.
* Land with a [Stability Index][] of Experimental. The module must remain
  Experimental until a semver-major release.

### Introducing new APIs on the global scope

Exposing new APIs to the global scope that are available without
an `import` or `require` call, including introducing new interfaces on
`globalThis` like `globalThis.navigator`, and adding new properties on
interfaces on `globalThis` like well known symbols, could break feature
detection and Node.js environment detection.

Exposing new APIs to the global scope unconditionally without any CLI
flags must always be labeled as `semver-major`. The `semver-major` label may
be waived through the regular TSC consensus process.

It is recommended to start with exposing APIs to the global scope with an
experimental CLI flag `--experimental-<feature-name>`, without being labeled as
`semver-major`. When the new APIs are feature complete, turn the flag on by
default with a CLI flag `--no-experimental-<feature-name>` to opt-out.

### Additions to Node-API

Node-API provides an ABI-stable API guaranteed for future Node.js versions.
Node-API additions call for unusual care and scrutiny. If a change adds to
`node_api.h`, `js_native_api.h`, `node_api_types.h`, or `js_native_api_types.h`,
consult [the relevant guide](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/HEAD/doc/contributing/adding-new-napi-api.md).

### Deprecations

Node.js uses three [Deprecation][] levels. For all deprecated APIs, the API
documentation must state the deprecation status.

* Documentation-Only Deprecation
  * A deprecation notice appears in the API documentation.
  * There are no functional changes.
  * By default, there will be no warnings emitted for such deprecations at
    runtime.
  * Might cause a runtime warning with the [`--pending-deprecation`][] flag or
    `NODE_PENDING_DEPRECATION` environment variable.

* Runtime Deprecation
  * Emits a warning at runtime on first use of the deprecated API.
  * If used with the [`--throw-deprecation`][] flag, will throw a runtime error.

* End-of-Life
  * The API is no longer subject to the semantic versioning rules.
  * Backward-incompatible changes including complete removal of such APIs can
    occur at any time.

Apply the `notable-change` label to all pull requests that introduce
Documentation-Only Deprecations. Such deprecations have no impact on code
execution. Thus, they are not breaking changes (`semver-major`).

Runtime Deprecations and End-of-Life APIs (internal or public) are breaking
changes (`semver-major`). The TSC can make exceptions, deciding that one of
these deprecations is not a breaking change.

Avoid Runtime Deprecations when an alias or a stub/no-op will suffice. An alias
or stub will have lower maintenance costs for end users and Node.js core.

All deprecations receive a unique and immutable identifier. Documentation,
warnings, and errors use the identifier when referring to the deprecation. The
documentation for the deprecation identifier must always remain in the API
documentation. This is true even if the deprecation is no longer in use (for
example, due to removal of an End-of-Life deprecated API).

<a id="deprecation-cycle"></a>
A _deprecation cycle_ is a major release during which an API has been in one of
the three Deprecation levels. Documentation-Only Deprecations can land in a
minor release. They can not change to a Runtime Deprecation until the next major
release.

No API can change to End-of-Life without going through a Runtime Deprecation
cycle. There is no rule that deprecated code must progress to End-of-Life.
Documentation-Only and Runtime Deprecations can remain in place for an unlimited
duration.

Communicate pending deprecations and associated mitigations with the ecosystem
as soon as possible. If possible, do it before the pull request adding the
deprecation lands on the `main` branch.

Use the `notable-change` label on pull requests that add or change the
deprecation level of an API.

### Involving the TSC

Collaborators can opt to elevate pull requests or issues to the [TSC][].
Do this if a pull request or issue:

* Has a significant impact on the codebase, or
* Is controversial, or
* Is at an impasse among collaborators who are participating in the discussion.

@-mention the `@nodejs/tsc` GitHub team if you want to elevate an issue to the
[TSC][]. Do not use the GitHub UI on the right-hand side to assign to
`@nodejs/tsc` or request a review from `@nodejs/tsc`.

If a pull request is labeled `semver-major`, you can request a review from the
`@nodejs/tsc` GitHub team.

The TSC serves as the final arbiter where required.

## Landing pull requests

1. Avoid landing pull requests that have someone else as an assignee. Authors
   who wish to land their own pull requests will self-assign them. Sometimes, an
   author will delegate to someone else. If in doubt, ask the assignee whether
   it is okay to land.
2. Never use GitHub's green ["Merge pull request"][] button. Reasons for not
   using the web interface button:
   * The "Create a merge commit" method will add an unnecessary merge commit.
   * The "Squash and merge" method will add metadata (the pull request #) to the
     commit title. If more than one author contributes to the pull request,
     squashing only keeps one author.
   * The "Rebase and merge" method has no way of adding metadata to the commit.
3. Make sure CI is complete and green. If the CI is not green, check for
   unreliable tests and infrastructure failures. If there are no corresponding
   issues in the [node][unreliable tests] or
   [build](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues) repositories, open new
   issues. Run a new CI any time someone pushes new code to the pull request.
4. Check that the commit message adheres to [commit message guidelines][].
5. Add all necessary [metadata][git-node-metadata] to commit messages before
   landing. If you are unsure exactly how to format the commit messages, use
   the commit log as a reference. See [this commit][commit-example] as an
   example.

For pull requests from first-time contributors, be
[welcoming](#welcoming-first-time-contributors). Also, verify that their git
settings are to their liking.

If a pull request contains more than one commit, it can be landed either by
squashing into one commit or by rebasing all the commits, or a mix of the two.
Generally, a collaborator should land a pull request by squashing. If a pull
request has more than one self-contained subsystem commits, a collaborator
may land it as several commits.

All commits should be self-contained, meaning every commit should pass all
tests. This makes it much easier when bisecting to find a breaking change.

### Using the commit queue GitHub labels

See the [commit queue guide][commit-queue.md].

### Using `git-node`

In most cases, using [the `git-node` command][git-node] of
[`@node-core/utils`][] is enough to land a pull request. If you discover a
problem when using this tool, please file an issue
[to the issue tracker][node-core-utils-issues].

Quick example:

```bash
npm install -g @node-core/utils
git node land $PRID
```

To use `@node-core/utils`, you will need a GitHub access token. If you do not
have one, `@node-core/utils` will create one for you the first time you use it.
To do this, it will ask for your GitHub password and two-factor authentication
code. If you wish to create the token yourself in advance, see
[the `@node-core/utils` guide][node-core-utils-credentials].

### Technical HOWTO

Infrequently, it is necessary to manually perform the steps required to land a
pull request rather than rely on `git-node`.

<details>
<Summary>Manual Landing Steps</Summary>

Clear any `am`/`rebase` that might already be underway:

```bash
git am --abort
git rebase --abort
```

Checkout proper target branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Update the tree (assumes your repository is set up as detailed in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](./pull-requests.md#step-1-fork)):

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge --ff-only upstream/main
```

Apply external patches:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/xxx.patch | git am --whitespace=fix
```

If the merge fails even though recent CI runs were successful, try a 3-way
merge:

```bash
git am --abort
curl -L https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/xxx.patch | git am -3 --whitespace=fix
```

If the 3-way merge succeeds, check the results against the original pull
request. Build and test on at least one platform before landing.

If the 3-way merge fails, then it is most likely that a conflicting pull request
has landed since the CI run. You will have to ask the author to rebase.

Check and re-review the changes:

```bash
git diff upstream/main
```

Check the number of commits and commit messages:

```bash
git log upstream/main...main
```

Squash commits and add metadata:

```bash
git rebase -i upstream/main
```

This will open a screen like this (in the default shell editor):

```text
pick 6928fc1 crypto: add feature A
pick 8120c4c add test for feature A
pick 51759dc crypto: feature B
pick 7d6f433 test for feature B

# Rebase f9456a2..7d6f433 onto f9456a2
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

Replace a couple of `pick`s with `fixup` to squash them into a
previous commit:

```text
pick 6928fc1 crypto: add feature A
fixup 8120c4c add test for feature A
pick 51759dc crypto: feature B
fixup 7d6f433 test for feature B
```

Replace `pick` with `reword` to change the commit message:

```text
reword 6928fc1 crypto: add feature A
fixup 8120c4c add test for feature A
reword 51759dc crypto: feature B
fixup 7d6f433 test for feature B
```

Save the file and close the editor. When prompted, enter a new commit message
for that commit. This is an opportunity to fix commit messages.

* The commit message text must conform to the [commit message guidelines][].
* <a name="metadata"></a>Change the original commit message to include metadata. (The
  [`git node metadata`][git-node-metadata] command can generate the metadata
  for you).

  * Required: A `PR-URL:` line that references the full GitHub URL of the pull
    request. This makes it easy to trace a commit back to the conversation that
    led up to that change.
  * Optional: A `Fixes: X` line, where _X_ is the full GitHub URL for an
    issue. A commit message can include more than one `Fixes:` lines.
  * Optional: One or more `Refs:` lines referencing a URL for any relevant
    background.
  * Required: A `Reviewed-By: Name <email>` line for each collaborator who
    reviewed the change.
    * Useful for @mentions / contact list if something goes wrong in the
      pull request.
    * Protects against the assumption that GitHub will be around forever.

Other changes might have landed on `main` since the successful CI run. As a
precaution, run tests (`make -j4 test` or `vcbuild test`).

Confirm that the commit message format is correct using
[core-validate-commit](https://github.com/nodejs/core-validate-commit).

```bash
git rev-list upstream/main...HEAD | xargs core-validate-commit
```

Optional: For your own commits, force push the amended commit to the pull
request branch. If your branch name is `bugfix`, then:
`git push --force-with-lease origin main:bugfix`. Don't close the pull
request. It will close after you push it upstream. It will have the purple
merged status rather than the red closed status. If you close the pull request
before GitHub adjusts its status, it will show up as a 0 commit pull
request with no changed files. The order of operations is important.
If you push upstream before you push to your branch, GitHub will close
the issue with the red closed status.

Time to push it:

```bash
git push upstream main
```

Close the pull request with a "Landed in `<commit hash>`" comment. Even if
your pull request shows the purple merged status,
add the "Landed in \<commit hash>..\<commit hash>" comment if you added
more than one commit.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, when running `git push upstream main`, you might get an error
message like this:

```console
To https://github.com/nodejs/node
 ! [rejected]              main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/nodejs/node'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

That means a commit has landed since your last rebase against `upstream/main`.
To fix this, pull with rebase from upstream, run the tests again, and (if the
tests pass) push again:

```bash
git pull upstream main --rebase
make -j4 test
git push upstream main
```

### I made a mistake

* Ping a TSC voting member.
* With `git`, there's a way to override remote trees by force pushing
  (`git push -f`). This is generally forbidden as it creates conflicts in other
  people's forks. It is permissible for simpler slip-ups such as typos in commit
  messages. You are only allowed to force push to any Node.js branch within 10
  minutes from your original push. If someone else pushes to the branch or the
  10-minute period passes, consider the commit final.
  * Use `--force-with-lease` to reduce the chance of overwriting someone else's
    change.

### Long Term Support

#### What is LTS?

Long Term Support (LTS) guarantees 30-month support cycles for specific Node.js
versions. You can find more information
[in the full release plan](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-plan). Once
a branch enters LTS, the release plan limits the types of changes permitted in
the branch.

#### How are LTS branches managed?

Each LTS release has a corresponding branch (v10.x, v8.x, etc.). Each also has a
corresponding staging branch (v10.x-staging, v8.x-staging, etc.).

Commits that land on `main` are cherry-picked to each staging branch as
appropriate. If a change applies only to the LTS branch, open the pull request
against the _staging_ branch. Commits from the staging branch land on the LTS
branch only when a release is being prepared. They might land on the LTS branch
in a different order than they do in staging.

Only members of @nodejs/backporters should land commits onto LTS staging
branches.

#### How can I help?

When you send your pull request, please state if your change is breaking. Also
state if you think your patch is a good candidate for backporting. For more
information on backporting, please see the [backporting guide][].

There are several LTS-related labels:

* `lts-watch-` labels are for pull requests to consider for landing in staging
  branches. For example, `lts-watch-v10.x` would be for a change
  to consider for the `v10.x-staging` branch.

* `land-on-` are for pull requests that should land in a future v\*.x
  release. For example, `land-on-v10.x` would be for a change to land in Node.js
  10.x.

Any collaborator can attach these labels to any pull request/issue. As commits
land on the staging branches, the backporter removes the `lts-watch-` label.
Likewise, as commits land in an LTS release, the releaser removes the `land-on-`
label.

Attach the appropriate `lts-watch-` label to any pull request that
might impact an LTS release.

## Labels

### General labels

* `confirmed-bug`: Bugs you have verified
* `discuss`: Things that need larger discussion
* `fast-track`: PRs that need to land faster - see
  [Waiting for approvals](#waiting-for-approvals)
* `feature request`: Any issue that requests a new feature
* `good first issue`: Issues suitable for newcomers to fix
* `meta`: Governance, policies, procedures, etc.
* `request-ci`: When this label is added to a PR, CI will be started
  automatically. See [Starting a Jenkins CI job](#starting-a-jenkins-ci-job)
* `tsc-agenda`: Open issues and pull requests with this label will be added to
  the Technical Steering Committee meeting agenda

***

* `author-ready` - A pull request is _author ready_ when:
  * There is a CI run in progress or completed.
  * There is at least one collaborator approval (or two TSC approvals for
    semver-major pull requests).
  * There are no outstanding review comments.

Please always add the `author ready` label to pull requests that qualify.
Please always remove it again as soon as the conditions are not met anymore,
such as if the CI run fails or a new outstanding review comment is posted.

***

* `semver-{minor,major}`
  * be conservative – that is, if a change has the remote _chance_ of breaking
    something, go for semver-major
  * when adding a semver label, add a comment explaining why you're adding it
  * minor vs. patch: roughly: "does it add a new method / does it add a new
    section to the docs"
  * major vs. everything else: run last versions tests against this version, if
    they pass, **probably** minor or patch

### LTS/version labels

We use labels to keep track of which branches a commit should land on:

* `dont-land-on-v?.x`
  * For changes that do not apply to a certain release line
  * Also used when the work of backporting a change outweighs the benefits
* `land-on-v?.x`
  * Used by releasers to mark a pull request as scheduled for inclusion in an
    LTS release
  * Applied to the original pull request for clean cherry-picks, to the backport
    pull request otherwise
* `backport-requested-v?.x`
  * Used to indicate that a pull request needs a manual backport to a branch in
    order to land the changes on that branch
  * Typically applied by a releaser when the pull request does not apply cleanly
    or it breaks the tests after applying
  * Will be replaced by either `dont-land-on-v?.x` or `backported-to-v?.x`
* `backported-to-v?.x`
  * Applied to pull requests for which a backport pull request has been merged
* `lts-watch-v?.x`
  * Applied to pull requests which the Release working group should consider
    including in an LTS release
  * Does not indicate that any specific action will be taken, but can be
    effective as messaging to non-collaborators
* `release-agenda`
  * For things that need discussion by the Release working group
  * (for example semver-minor changes that need or should go into an LTS
    release)
* `v?.x`
  * Automatically applied to changes that do not target `main` but rather the
    `v?.x-staging` branch

Once a release line enters maintenance mode, the corresponding labels do not
need to be attached anymore, as only important bugfixes will be included.

### Other labels

* Operating system labels
  * `macos`, `windows`, `smartos`, `aix`, `linux`, etc.
* Architecture labels
  * `arm`, `mips`, `s390`, `ppc`, etc.
  * No `x86{_64}` label because it is the implied default
