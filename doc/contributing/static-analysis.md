# Static Analysis

The project uses Coverity to scan Node.js source code and to report potential
issues in the C/C++ code base.

Those who have been added to the Node.js coverity project can receive emails
when there are new issues reported as well as view all current issues
through <https://scan9.coverity.com/reports.htm>.

Any collaborator can ask to be added to the Node.js coverity project
by opening an issue in the [build](https://github.com/nodejs/build) repository
titled `Please add me to coverity`. A member of the build WG with admin
access will verify that the requestor is an existing collaborator as listed in
the [collaborators section](https://github.com/nodejs/node#collaborators)
on the nodejs/node project repo. Once validated the requestor will added
to the coverity project.
