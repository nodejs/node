## bluesky

Bluesky is managed directly by the project. Automation is used
to request posts/reposts as outlined in
[nodejs/bluesky](https://github.com/nodejs/bluesky).

Login credentials are available to members of the Technical
Steering Committee, but are not to be used directly except
in exceptional circumstances.

## Twitter/X

Day to day management of the Twitter/X account has been
delegated to the Foundation Staff.

In addition, it has been agreed that Releasers may login
and post when doing a release, and TSC members may post
an announcement of a release if a releaser is not able to
do it themselves.

Login credentials are available to members of the Technical
Steering Committee. Releasers may request access by
opening an issue in the nodejs/admin repo asking for access.

delegated to the Foundation Staff.

No project members have access to the Facebook account.
