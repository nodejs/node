// +--------+--------------+----------+----------+
// |   ON   | Initiated By | Readable | Writable |
// +--------+--------------+----------+----------+

// All data sent via the Stream is buffered internally until either receipt is
// acknowledged from the peer or attempts to send are abandoned. The fact that
// data is buffered in memory makes it essential that the flow control for the
// session and the stream are properly handled. For now, we are largely relying
// on ngtcp2's default flow control mechanisms which generally should be doing
// the right thing.
//
// A Stream may be in a fully closed state (No longer readable nor writable)
// state but still have unacknowledged data in both the inbound and outbound
// queues.
//
// A Stream is gracefully closed when (a) both read and write states are closed,
// (b) all queued data has been acknowledged.
//
// The Stream may be forcefully closed immediately using destroy(err). This
// causes all queued outbound data and pending JavaScript writes are abandoned,
// and causes the Stream to be immediately closed at the ngtcp2 level without
// waiting for any outstanding acknowledgements. Keep in mind, however, that the
// peer is not notified that the stream is destroyed and may attempt to continue
// sending data and acknowledgements.
//
// QUIC streams in general do not have headers. Some QUIC applications, however,
// may associate headers with the stream (HTTP/3 for instance).
//
// Streams may be created in a pending state. This means that while the Stream
// object is created, it has not yet been opened in ngtcp2 and therefore has
// no official status yet. Certain operations can still be performed on the
// stream object such as providing data and headers, and destroying the stream.
//
// When a stream is created the data source for the stream must be given.
// If no data source is given, then the stream is assumed to not have any
// outbound data. The data source can be fixed length or may support
// streaming. What this means practically is, when a stream is opened,
// you must already have a sense of whether that will provide data or
// not. When in doubt, specify a streaming data source, which can produce
// zero-length output.
