      # The `npm ci` for this step fails a lot as part of the Test step. Run it
      # now so that we don't have to wait 2 hours for the Build step to pass
      # first before that failure happens. (And if there's something about
      # `make run-ci -j2` that is causing the failure and the failure doesn't
      # happen anymore running this step here first, that's also useful
      # information.)
