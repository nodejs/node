# Support

Node.js contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please make sure you are using a [currently-supported version of
Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/), especially the
  [API docs](https://nodejs.org/api/)
* [Node.js Help](https://github.com/nodejs/help)
* [Open or closed issues in the Node.js GitHub organization](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+org%3Anodejs+is%3Aissue)

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial
resources:

* [Questions tagged 'node.js' on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js)
* [#nodejs](https://openjs-foundation.slack.com/archives/CK9Q4MB53) channel on the OpenJS Foundation Slack ([join here](https://slack-invite.openjsf.org/))
* [#node.js channel on libera.chat](https://web.libera.chat?channels=node.js&uio=d4)
* [Node.js Slack Community](https://node-js.slack.com/)

GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.

The open source license grants you the freedom to use Node.js. It does not
guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage
your expectations.
