# Node.js Support Guide

Node.js contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please make sure you are using a
[currently-supported version of Node.js][1].

When seeking support, please first search for your question in these venues:

- [Node.js Website][2], especially the [API docs][3]
- [Node.js Help][4]
- [Open or closed issues in the Node.js GitHub organization][5]

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial
resources:

- [Questions tagged 'node.js' on Stack Overflow][6]
- [#node.js channel on libera.chat][7]
- [Node.js Slack Community][8] *(Register at [nodeslackers.com][9])*

GitHub issues are for tracking enhancements and bugs, not general support.

The open source license grants you the freedom to use Node.js. It does not
guarantee commitments of other people's time. Please be respectful and manage
your expectations.

## Troubleshooting Steps

When encountering issues with Node.js, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check Node.js Version**: Ensure you are using a currently-supported
version of Node.js. You can check the supported versions [here][1].

2. **Review Documentation**: Consult the official [Node.js documentation][2]
and the [API docs][3] for relevant information.

3. **Search for Solutions**: Utilize the search functionality on the Node.js
website, GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, or other community platforms to find
solutions to your problem.

4. **Check for Updates**: Ensure your Node.js dependencies and packages are
up-to-date by running `npm update` or `npm outdated`.

5. **Review Error Messages**: Pay attention to error messages and logs to
identify the root cause of the issue.

6. **Isolate the Problem**: Try to reproduce the issue in a minimal environment
to isolate the problem. This helps in pinpointing the cause and finding a
solution.

7. **Debugging**: Use debugging tools such as Node.js built-in debugger, or
third-party tools like `node-inspect`, to debug your application.

8. **Community Forums**: If you're unable to resolve the issue on your own,
seek help from the Node.js community through forums, chat channels, or
Slack.

## How to Ask a Good Question

When asking for help with Node.js, follow these guidelines to increase the
chances of receiving helpful responses:

- **Look for Duplicates**: More often than not, someone else has had your issue
before, so it's extremely important to search for a solution before asking a
question.

- **Provide Context**: Clearly explain what you are trying to accomplish,
what you have attempted so far, and any relevant background information.

- **Include Code**: If applicable, include a minimal, complete, and verifiable
example of your code that reproduces the issue.

- **Error Messages**: Include any error messages or stack traces you've
encountered.

- **Versions**: Specify the versions of Node.js, npm, and any relevant
dependencies you are using.

- **Be Polite**: Remember to be polite and respectful to those who are trying
to help you.

## What to Ask/Not to Ask

### Do Ask:

- Specific questions about Node.js features, APIs, or best practices.
- Questions about troubleshooting specific errors or issues.
- Clarification on concepts or documentation you don't understand.
- Questions about performance optimization or code refactoring.

### Don't Ask:

- General programming questions unrelated to Node.js.
- Questions asking for complete solutions without showing any effort.
- Questions about third-party libraries without first consulting their
documentation or community.
- Questions that violate the Node.js code of conduct or are disrespectful to others.

Remember, asking good questions leads to better answers and a more positive experience for everyone involved in the Node.js community.
