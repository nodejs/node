# Support

Node.js contributors have limited availability to address general support
questions. Please make sure you are using a [currently-supported version of
Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule).

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

* [Node.js Website](https://nodejs.org/en/), especially the
  [API docs](https://nodejs.org/api/) or the [Learn material](https://nodejs.org/en/learn)
* [Node.js's GitHub Help repository](https://github.com/nodejs/help)
* [Open or closed issues in the Node.js GitHub organization](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+org%3Anodejs+is%3Aissue)
* [Ask for support on Node.js's Discord server](https://nodejs.org/discord)

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, try these unofficial
resources:

* [Questions tagged 'node.js' on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/node.js)
* [#node.js channel on libera.chat](https://web.libera.chat?channels=node.js&uio=d4)
* [Node.js Slack Community](https://node-js.slack.com/)

The open source license grants you the freedom to use Node.js. It does not

your expectations.
