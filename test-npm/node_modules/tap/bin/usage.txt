Usage:
  tap [options] <files>

Executes all the files and interprets their output as TAP
formatted test result data.

To parse TAP data from stdin, specify "-" as a filename.

Short options are parsed gnu-style, so for example '-bCRspec' would be
equivalent to '--bail --no-color --reporter=spec'

If the --check-coverage or --coverage-report options are provided, but
no test files are specified, then a coverage report or coverage check
will be run on the data from the last test run.

Coverage is never enabled for stdin.

Options:

  -c --color                  Use colors (Default for TTY)

  -C --no-color               Do not use colors (Default for non-TTY)

  -b --bail                   Bail out on first failure

  -B --no-bail                Do not bail out on first failure (Default)

  -R<type> --reporter=<type>  Use the specified reporter.  Defaults to
                              'classic' when colors are in use, or 'tap'
                              when colors are disabled.

                              Available reporters:

  -s<file> --save=<file>      If <file> exists, then it should be a line-
                              delimited list of test files to run.  If
                              <file> is not present, then all command-line
                              positional arguments are run.

                              After the set of test files are run, any
                              failed test files are written back to the
                              save file.

                              This way, repeated runs with -s<file> will
                              re-run failures until all the failures are
                              passing, and then once again run all tests.

                              It's a good idea to .gitignore the file
                              used for this purpose, as it will churn a
                              lot.

  --coverage --cov            Capture coverage information using 'nyc'

                              If a COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN environment
                              variable is set, then coverage is
                              captured by default and sent to the
                              coveralls.io service.

  --no-coverage --no-cov      Do not capture coverage information.
                              Note that if nyc is already loaded, then
                              the coverage info will still be captured.

  --coverage-report=<type>    Output coverage information using the
                              specified istanbul/nyc reporter type.

                              Default is 'text' when running on the
                              command line, or 'text-lcov' when piping
                              to coveralls.

                              If 'html' is used, then the report will
                              be opened in a web browser after running.

                              This can be run on its own at any time
                              after a test run that included coverage.

  --no-coverage-report        Do not output a coverage report.

  --no-browser                Do not open a web browser after
                              generating an html coverage report.

  -t<n> --timeout=<n>         Time out test files after <n> seconds.
                              Defaults to 30, or the value of the
                              TAP_TIMEOUT environment variable.

  -h --help                   print this thing you're looking at

  -v --version                show the version of this program

  --node-arg=<arg>            Pass an argument to Node binary in all
                              child processes.  Run 'node --help' to
                              see a list of all relevant arguments.
                              This can be specified multiple times to
                              pass multiple args to Node.

  -gc --expose-gc             Expose the gc() function to Node tests

  --debug                     Run JavaScript tests with node --debug

  --debug-brk                 Run JavaScript tests with node --debug-brk

  --harmony                   Enable all Harmony flags in JavaScript tests

  --strict                    Run JS tests in 'use strict' mode

  --test-arg=<arg>            Pass an argument to test files spawned
                              by the tap command line executable.
                              This can be specified multiple times to
                              pass multiple args to test scripts.

  --nyc-arg=<arg>             Pass an argument to nyc when running
                              child processes with coverage enabled.
                              This can be specified multiple times to
                              pass multiple args to nyc.

  --check-coverage            Check whether coverage is within
                              thresholds provided.  Setting this
                              explicitly will default --coverage to
                              true.

                              This can be run on its own any time
                              after a test run that included coverage.

  --branches                  what % of branches must be covered?
                              Setting this will default both
                              --check-coverage and --coverage to true.
                              [default: 0]

  --functions                 what % of functions must be covered?
                              Setting this explicitly will default both
                              --check-coverage and --coverage to true.
                              [default: 0]

  --lines                     what % of lines must be covered?
                              Setting this explicitly will default both
                              --check-coverage and --coverage to true.
                              [default: 90]

  --statements                what % of statements must be covered?
                              Setting this explicitly will default both
                              --check-coverage and --coverage to true.
                              [default: 0]

  --100                       Full coverage, 100%.
                              Sets branches, statements, functions,
                              and lines to 100.

  --nyc-help                  Print nyc usage banner.  Useful for
                              viewing options for --nyc-arg.

  --nyc-version               Print version of nyc used by tap.

  --dump-config               Dump the config options in JSON format.

  --                          Stop parsing flags, and treat any additional
                              command line arguments as filenames.

Environment Variables:

  TAP_RCFILE                  A yaml formatted file which can set any
                              of the above options.  Defaults to
                              $HOME/.taprc

  TAP_TIMEOUT                 Default value for --timeout option.

  TAP_COLORS                  Set to '1' to force color output, or '0'
                              to prevent color output.

  TAP_BAIL                    Bail out on the first test failure.
                              Used internally when '--bailout' is set.

  TAP                         Set to '1' to force standard TAP output,
                              and suppress any reporters.  Used when
                              running child tests so that their output
                              is parseable by the test harness.

Config Files:

You can create a yaml file with any of the options above.  By default,
the file at ~/.taprc will be loaded, but the TAP_RCFILE environment
variable can modify this.

Run 'tap --dump-config' for a listing of what can be set in that file.
Each of the keys corresponds to one of the options above.
