# json(1) -- JSON love for your command line


## SYNOPSIS

something-generating-JSON-on-stdout | `json` \[OPTIONS\] \[LOOKUPS\]

`json` -f FILE \[OPTIONS\] \[LOOKUPS...\]


## DESCRIPTION

`json` is a fast command-line tool for working with JSON content from the
command line. Among its features: streaming stdin/stdout or working with JSON
files, pretty-printing with control over output formats, JSON validation,
filtering, modification, in-place JSON file modification, field extraction,
tabular output, skipping HTTP header blocks for use with REST API responses,
JSON stream ('\n'-separated JSON objects) processing.

Read on for details and examples. The FEATURE sections describe `json`
features roughly in the order of processing.


## FEATURE: HTTP Header Stripping

`json` roots are as a tool to assist working with REST APIs. Often results
being parsed include HTTP headers, as from `curl -i`, with a JSON payload.
By default `json` passes through HTTP header blocks. Use `-H` to strip a
leading HTTP header block.


## FEATURE: Grouping

(Added in json v4.) Use '-g' or '--group' to group adjacent objects into a
single JSON array or to concatenate adjacent arrays into a single array. E.g.:

    $ echo '{"a":1}
    {"b": 2}' | json -g
    [
      {
        "a": 1
      },
      {
        "b": 2
      }
    ]

    $ echo '["one"]
    ["two"]' | json -g
    [
      "one",
      "two"
    ]

"Adjacent" objects means objects separated by a newline, or by no space at all.
Adjacent *arrays* means separate by a newline. These conditions are chosen as
a balance between (a) not being ambiguous to parse with a simple regex and
(b) enough to be useful for common cases.

*Compatibility note:* In json v3 and earlier, this used to be called
"auto-arrayification" and was implicit. In json v4 and v5 grouping of adjacent
arrays separated by no space was allowed. That was dropped in v6 (see
[issue #55](https://github.com/trentm/json/issues/55)). See the
[COMPATIBILITY][] section below.


## FEATURE: Streaming

Grouping can be helpful for "one JSON object per line" formats or for things
such as:

    $ cat *.json | json -g ...

However, when the size of the input is large practically one must do stream
processing. As of json v5.1, `json -ga` will **stream**. An extreme example is:

    $ yes '{"foo":"bar"}' | json -ga

But a more practical example would be a large file of newline-separated
JSON objects, such as a [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan)
log file:

    $ cat foo.log | json -ga req.method req.url res.headers.x-response-time
    GET /ping 1
    POST /images 43
    ...


## FEATURE: Merging

(Added in json v4.) Use '--merge' or '--deep-merge' to **merge adjacent JSON
objects** in the input. Keys in the last object win.

    $ echo '{"one":"un","two":"deux"}
    {"one":"uno","three":"tres"}' | json --merge
    {
      "one": "uno",
      "two": "deux",
      "three": "tres"
    }

This could be useful for merging multiple config files, e.g.:

    $ cat /opt/app/etc/defaults.json \
        /etc/app/config.json \
        ~/.app/config.json | json --merge
    ...


## FEATURE: Itemizing

(Added in json v9.) Looking up fields in an array of object is easy with `json`:

    $ echo '[{"name":"trent","age":38},
             {"name":"ewan","age":4}]' | json -a name age
    trent 38
    ewan 4

but less so when a set of objects is indexed by key in an object:

    $ echo '{"trent":{"age":38},
             "ewan": {"age":4}}' | ...    # How to list ages?

The `-M, --items` option allows one to **itemize the key/value pairs of
an object** for convenient iteration with `-a`:

    $ echo '{"trent":{"age":38},
             "ewan": {"age":4}}' | json -M
    [
      {
        "key": "trent",
        "value": {
          "age": 38
        }
      },
      {
        "key": "ewan",
        "value": {
          "age": 4
        }
      }
    ]

    $ echo '{"trent":{"age":38},
             "ewan": {"age":4}}' | json -Ma key value.age
    trent 38
    ewan 4

    # List people that can vote.
    $ echo '{"trent":{"age":38},
             "ewan": {"age":4}}' | json -M -c 'this.value.age > 18' -a key
    trent


## FEATURE: Validation

`json` will give position information and context for JSON syntax errors
(`SyntaxError`). This can be handy for validating data and config files:

    $ cat config.json | json
    json: error: input is not JSON: Unexpected ',' at line 17, column 5:
                , { "name": "smartos64-1.4.7"
            ....^
    {
        "use-proxy": false
    ...
    $ echo $?
    1

Processing and output of the input JSON can be suppressed with the
`-n, --validate` option:

    $ cat config.json | json --validate
    json: error: input is not JSON: Unexpected ',' at line 17, column 5:
                , { "name": "smartos64-1.4.7"
            ....^

Together with the `-q` you can get silent, exit-status-only, JSON validation:

    $ cat config.json | json -nq
    $ echo $?
    1


## FEATURE: Execution

Use the `-e CODE` option to execute (JavaScript) code on the input JSON.

    $ echo '{"name":"trent","age":38}' | json -e 'this.age++'
    {
      "name": "trent",
      "age": 39
    }

If input is an array, this will automatically process each item separately:

    $ echo '[{"age":38},{"age":4}]' | json -e this.age++
    [
      {
        "age": 39
      },
      {
        "age": 5
      }
    ]

That can be overriden with `-A`:

    $ echo '[{"age":38},{"age":4}]' | json -A -e 'this[0].age = "unknown"'
    [
      {
        "age": "unknown"
      },
      {
        "age": 4
      }
    ]

The given CODE is executed in a function bound to the input object (i.e.
`this` is the input object).

*Security note:* `CODE` is *not* executed in a sandbox, so `json`'s globals are
available and unguarded. You can shoot yourself in the foot. *Do not pass
untrusted user-supplied strings here.*

*Compatibility note:* In versions before v9 `-e CODE` used an alternate
implementation (with slightly different semantics for the CODE). It is still
supported for backward compatibility by using the `JSON_EXEC=vm` environment
variable. However it is deprecated because it can cause processing to be *10x*
or more slower for large inputs. See the [COMPATIBILITY][] section below.


## FEATURE: Conditional filtering

Use the `-c CODE` option to run JavaScript code ending with a statement
returning a boolean to filter the input JSON.

    $ echo '[{"age":38},{"age":4}]' | json -c 'this.age > 21'
    [{"age":38}]

As with `-e` above, if input is an array, this will automatically process each
item separately. This can be overriden with `-A`.

The given CODE is executed in a function bound to the input object (i.e.
`this` is the input object). A JavaScript function must use `return` to return
a value, so as a convenience if "return" is not in the given CODE it is presumed
to be a single statement and it is wrapped:

    function () {
        return ( CODE );
    }

To use multiple statements in `-c CODE` you must explicitly use `return`, e.g.:

    $ echo '{"a": 2, "b": 6}' | json -c 'sum = this.a + this.b; return sum > 5'
    {
      "a": 2,
      "b": 6
    }

*Security note:* `CODE` is *not* executed in a sandbox, so `json`'s globals are
available and unguarded. You can shoot yourself in the foot. *Do not pass
untrusted user-supplied strings here.*

*Compatibility note:* In versions before v9 `-c CODE` used an alternate
implementation (with slightly different semantics for the CODE). It is still
supported for backward compatibility by using the `JSON_EXEC=vm` environment
variable. However it is deprecated because it can cause processing to be *10x*
or more slower for large inputs. See the [COMPATIBILITY][] section below.


## FEATURE: Lookups

Use lookup arguments to extract particular values:

    $ echo '{"name":"trent","age":38}' | json name
    trent

Use '.' in a single lookup to do property access (e.g. `name.first`) and use
multiple args to lookup multiple fields.

    $ echo '{"name": {"first": "Trent", "last": "Mick"}, "age": 38}' \
        | json name.first age
    Trent
    38

Use `-a` for *Array processing* of lookups and *tAbular output*:

    $ echo '{"name":"trent","age":38}' | json name
    trent
    $ echo '[{"name":"trent","age":38},
             {"name":"ewan","age":4}]' | json -a name age
    trent 38
    ewan 4

Integral values work for array index lookups:

    $ echo '["a", "b", "c"]' | json 1
    b

Negative array indices are also supported for convenience (a la Python array
indexing):

    $ echo '["a", "b", "c"]' | json -- -1
    c
    $ echo '["a", "b", "c"]' | json -- -2
    b

If your lookup isn't a number or [a JS
indentifier](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_variables,_and_literals#Variables)
you can always use **JavaScript array-style lookups** like this:

    $ echo '{"http://example.com": "my-value"}' | json '["http://example.com"]'
    my-value

just like you would in JavaScript:

    $ node
    > var d = {"http://example.com": "my-value"}
    > d["http://example.com"]
    'my-value'

Or it might be easier to set **an alternate lookup delimiter**:

    $ echo '{"http://example.com": "my-value"}' | json -D, http://example.com
    my-value

    $ echo '{"etc": {"resolv.conf":1, "passwd":2}}' | json -D/ etc/resolv.conf
    1


## FEATURE: Pretty-printing

Output is "jsony" by default: 2-space indented JSON ...

    $ echo '{"name": "trent", "age": 38}' | json
    {
      "name": "trent",
      "age": 38
    }

... with one exception, a bare string value is printed without quotes (because
who wants to deal with quotes in your pipeline?).

    $ echo '{"name": "trent", "age": 38}' | json name
    trent

If pure JSON output is wanted, use `-o json` or the `-j` shortcut:

    $ echo '{"name": "trent", "age": 38}' | json -o json name
    "trent"

Indentations other than 2 can be selected via `-o json-N`

    $ echo '{"name": "trent", "age": 38}' | json -o json-0
    {"name":"trent","age":38}
    $ echo '{"name": "trent", "age": 38}' | json -o json-4
    {
        "name": "trent",
        "age": 38
    }

The "FORMAT-N" suffix can also be useful on "jsony" when selecting multiple
values and wanting tabular output where some cells are objects:

    $ cat users.json
    [
       {"name": {"first": "Trent", "last": "Mick"}, "age": 38},
       {"name": {"first": "Ewan", "last": "Mick"}, "age": 4}
    ]

    $ json -f users.json -a name age -o jsony-0
    {"first":"Trent","last":"Mick"} 38
    {"first":"Ewan","last":"Mick"} 4

Further the `-0`, `-2`, and `-4` shortcuts can be used to set the indentation
without changing the mode. This can be use to make the above shorter:

    $ json -f users.json -a name age -0
    {"first":"Trent","last":"Mick"} 38
    {"first":"Ewan","last":"Mick"} 4

You can get colored (non-JSON) output using node.js's
[`util.inspect`](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/all.html#util.inspect):

    $ echo '[{"name": "Trent"},{"name": "Ewan"}]' | json -o inspect
    [ { name: 'Trent' },
      { name: 'Ewan' } ]


## FEATURE: Listing keys

Sometimes you want the list of keys for an object. Use `-k` or `--keys` for
that:

    $ echo '{"name": "trent", "age": 38}' | json -k
    [
      "name",
      "age"
    ]
    $ echo '{"name": "trent", "age": 38}' | json -ka
    name
    age


## FEATURE: In-place editing

You can edit a file in place with `-I` and `-f FILE`:

    $ cat config.json
    {"hostname":"127.0.0.1"}

    $ json -I -f config.json                        # format the file
    json: updated "config.json" in-place
    $ cat config.json
    {
      "hostname": "127.0.0.1"
    }

    $ json -I -f config.json -e 'this.port=8080'    # add port field
    json: updated "config.json" in-place
    $ cat config.json
    {
      "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
      "port": 8080
    }

Some limitations. Only one file at a time:

    $ json -I -f foo.json -f bar.json
    json: error: must specify exactly one file with '-f FILE' to use -I/--in-place

Lookups are not allowed:

    $ json -I -f foo.json key.subkey
    json: error: lookups cannot be specified with in-place editing (-I/--in-place), too easy to lose content

because that can too easily result in data loss, e.g. with something like:

    $ json -I -f *.json    # if there is more than one match to the glob
    json: error: lookups cannot be specified with in-place editing (-I/--in-place), too easy to lose content


## OPTIONS

  * `-h`, `--help`:
    Print this help info and exit.

  * `--version`:
    Print version of this command and exit.

  * `-q, --quiet`:
    Don't warn if input isn't valid JSON.


By default `json` will process input from stdin. Alternatively, an input file
(or files) can be specified:

  * `-f FILE`:
    Specify an input file (instead of stdin).


By default `json` output is to stdout. Together with `-f FILE`, in-place
editing can be done:

  * `-I`, `--in-place`:
    Edit the file given with `-f FILE` in-place. Lookups are not allowed
    with in-place editing, because it is too easy to accidentally lose file
    data.


If your JSON output is a REST API response, it might include the headers
(e.g. when calling with `curl -i`). By default `json` will pass those headers
through (without choking on them). However if you want them stripped you
can use:

  * `-H`:
    drop any HTTP header block (as from `curl -i ...`)

Other pre-JSON input handling:

  * `-g`, `--group`:
    Group adjacent objects into an array of objects, or concatenate adjacent
    arrays into a single array.

  * `--merge`, `--deep-merge`:
    Merge adjacent objects into a single object with merged keys. Values
    in later objects win. Use `--deep-merge` to recursively merge keys in
    objects.

  * `-M`, `--items`:
    Itemize an object into an array of `{"key": <key>, "value": <value>}`
    objects for easier processing.

You can process elements of an input array separately and generate tabular
output:

  * `-a`, `--array`:
    Process input as an array of separate inputs and output in tabular form.

  * `-d DELIM`:
    Delimiter character for tabular output (default is ' ').

  * `-A`:
    Process input as a single object, i.e. stop `-e` and `-c` automatically
    processing each item of an input array.

You can execute code on (`-e`) and filter (`-c`) the input (this is done before
LOOKUPS are processed, if any).

  * `-e CODE`:
    Execute the given JavaScript code on the input. If input is an array, then
    each item of the array is processed separately (use `-A` to override). Use
    `this.` to access fields on the object being processed. (`-E CODE` is a now
    deprecated synonym.)

  * `-c CODE`:
    Filter the input with JavaScript `CODE`. If `CODE` returns false-y, then
    the item is filtered out. If input is an array, then each item of the array
    is processed separately (use `-A` to override). Use `this.` to access fields
    on the object being processed. An explicit `return` is required if `CODE`
    includes multiple statements. (`-C CODE` is a now deprecated synonym.)


Finally, if `LOOKUP` arguments are given, these are extracted from the
JSON. By default `.` is used as a separator for nested object lookup.
This can be overridden:

  * `-D DELIM`:
    Delimiter char between LOOKUPS (default is '.'). For example:
    `$ echo '{"a.b": {"b": 1}}' | json -D / a.b/b`


An alternative to lookups is to output the keys of the input object:

  * `-k`, `--keys`:
    Output the input object's keys.


`json` can be restricting to just validating its input, i.e. processing
and output of the input is skipped:

  * `-n`, `--validate`:
    Just validate the input, no processing or output of the JSON content.


By default `json` outputs in "jsony" mode. Basically this is JSON output,
with the exception that a single string output value is emitted without the
quotes. The intention here is to be of most use to the UNIX command-line.
Other output formats are supported:

  * `-o MODE`, `--output MODE`:
    Specify an output mode. One of `jsony` (the default; JSON, if a single
    string then quotes are elided), `json` (JSON output, 2-space indent),
    or `inspect` (node.js `util.inspect` output). `json` and `jsony` modes can
    specify an indentation via `json-N` or `jsony-N` for N-space indentation
    (e.g. `json-4`), or via `json-tab` or `jsony-tab` for TAB indentation.

  * `-i`:
    Shortcut for `-o inspect`.

  * `-j`:
    Shortcut for `-o json`.

  * `-0`, `-2`, `-4`:
    Set the JSON indentation without changing the mode.


## ENVIRONMENT

  * `JSON_EXEC=vm`:
    Set this to turn on the old (pre-v9) behaviour of `-e CODE` and `-c CODE`.


## EXAMPLES

A typical JSON REST API response:

    $ curl -s http://ifconfig.me/all.json
    {"connection":"","ip_addr":"216.57.203.67","lang":"","remote_host":...

**Nice output by default**:

    $ curl -s http://ifconfig.me/all.json | json
    {
      "connection": "",
      "ip_addr": "201.73.103.12",
      "lang": "",
      "remote_host": "",
      "user_agent": "curl/7.23.1 (i386-sun-solaris2.11) libcurl/7.23.1 OpenSSL/0.9.8w zlib/1.2.3 libidn/1.23 libssh2/1.2.2",
      "charset": "",
      "port": "63713",
      "via": "",
      "forwarded": "",
      "mime": "*/*",
      "keep_alive": "",
      "encoding": ""
    }

Say you just want to **extract one value**:

    $ curl -s http://ifconfig.me/all.json | json ip_addr
    201.73.103.12

Or, looking at the [node.js project](https://github.com/joyent/node) using
the Github API:

    $ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node | json open_issues
    517

If you use `curl -i` to get HTTP headers (because perhaps they contain
relevant information), **json will skip the HTTP headers automatically**:

    $ curl -is https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node | json
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.0.13
    Date: Tue, 24 Jul 2012 04:01:08 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Connection: keep-alive
    Status: 200 OK
    ETag: "1a21d980a01768dde42145ce2b58694c"
    X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4997
    Content-Length: 1513
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=60
    Vary: Accept
    X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
    Last-Modified: Tue, 24 Jul 2012 03:50:11 GMT

    {
      "master_branch": "master",
      "has_issues": true,
      "has_downloads": false,
      "homepage": "http://nodejs.org/",
      "html_url": "https://github.com/joyent/node",
    ...

Or, say you are stuck with the headers in your pipeline, **'json -H' will
drop HTTP headers**:

    $ curl -is https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node | json -H forks
    2158

Here is **an example that shows indexing a list**. (The given "lookup"
argument is basically JavaScript code appended, with '.' if necessary, to the
JSON data and eval'd.)

    $ curl -s https://api.github.com/legacy/repos/search/nodejs \
        | json 'repositories[2].name'
    socket.io

Having the quote to avoid shell interpretation of '[' is annoying, so `json`
allows a special case for an integer lookup:

    $ curl -s https://api.github.com/legacy/repos/search/nodejs \
        | json 'repositories.2.name'
    socket.io


### Array processing with -a

`json` includes the `-a` (aka `--array`) option for **processing each element of
an input JSON array independently** and **using tabular output**. Let's first
get a list of open node.js issues (note that this is a subset because of
[GH API pagination](http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination)):

    $ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node/issues?state=open\&per_page=100
    [
      {
        "number": 3757,
        "html_url": "https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3757",
        "body": "Fix #3756.\n\nReview, please: @TooTallNate",
        "milestone": null,
        "user": {
          "gravatar_id": "73a2b24daecb976af81e010b7a3ce3c6",
          "login": "isaacs",
          "avatar_url": "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73a2b24dae...
    ...

We can then print a table with just some fields as follows:

    $ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node/issues?state=open\&per_page=100 \
        | json -a comments number title
    0 3757 readline: Remove event listeners on close
    0 3756 readline: No way to completely unhook interface from input/output
    1 3755 node-v0.6.20 hello example segfaults on RaspberryPi (w/Arch + bash)
    0 3753 Prohibit same listeners in EventEmitter. Closes #964.
    1 3752 Auto-detect hardfloat eabi and armv7 variables on ARM based on compiler
    3 3751 persistent REPL history
    0 3749 glibc errors on SheevaPlug / Debian Squeeze
    ...

Ultimately this can be useful for then using other command-line tools. For
example, we could get the list of top-five most commented open node issues:

    $ curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node/issues?state=open\&per_page=100 \
        | json -a comments number title | sort -n  | tail -5
    9 3510 Automatically `.toString()` functions in REPL.
    11 3668 JSON documentation index listing
    12 3624 Add a return value to Buffer.write* methods that returns the ...
    12 3655 defer dgram listening event
    14 3613 Connections closed by node stay permanently in FIN_WAIT2

## COMPATIBILITY

The json tool major version is incremented when there is a backward incompatible
change. An overview of those changes is here.

- v9: `-e CODE` and `-c CODE` switch away from using `vm.runInNewContext` for
  processing. In other words they now do what `-E` and `-C` do, and the
  uppercase options are not deprecated synonyms. Use the `JSON_EXEC=vm`
  environment variable to bring back the old behaviour.
- v8: No incompatible change. The npm registry name changed from 'jsontool' to
  'json'.
- v7: `-E CODE` and `-C CODE` were added in favour of `-e CODE` and `-c CODE`
  because the former provide a 10x or more performance improvement for
  larger inputs. The latter are still included for backward compatibility.
  `-E/-C` use a JavaScript function to execute CODE, which `-e/-c` use node.js's
  `vm.runInNewContext` which is crazy slow. Use of a JavaScript function
  places slightly different semantics and requirements on the given `CODE`, so
  new options were required for compat.
- v6: Grouping (via `-g` or `--group`) of adjacent *arrays* no longer groups
  arrays separated by no space. I.e. adjacent arrays must be separated by a
  newline.
- v5: Special case the output for **a single lookup AND JSON output** (i.e. `-j`
  or `-o json*`) to only output the value instead of the more general array or
  table that is necessary for multiple lookups.
- v4: Made "auto-arrayification" require an explicit '-g' or '--group' option
  to prefer that implicit processing never magically fix otherwise invalid
  JSON. The feature is now called grouping.
- v3: Cleaned up json and "jsony" output formatting to be more consistent,
  especially for array processing.

## INSTALL, PROJECT, BUGS

`json` is written in JavaScript and requires node.js (`node`). You can either
install via `npm`:

    npm install -g json

or manually get the script and put it on your PATH somewhere (`json` is a single
file with no external deps other than node itself):

    cd ~/bin
    curl -L https://github.com/trentm/json/raw/master/lib/json.js > json
    chmod 755 json

(Note: Before version 8, this tool was called "jsontool" in the npm
registry. That name is now defunct.)
