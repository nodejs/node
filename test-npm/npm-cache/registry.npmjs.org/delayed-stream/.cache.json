events from a stream until you are ready to handle them.\n\n## Installation\n\n``` bash\nnpm install delayed-stream\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe following example shows how to write a http echo server that delays its\nresponse by 1000 ms.\n\n``` javascript\nvar DelayedStream = require('delayed-stream');\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function(req, res) {\n  var delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    res.writeHead(200);\n    delayed.pipe(res);\n  }, 1000);\n});\n```\n\nIf you are not using `Stream#pipe`, you can also manually release the buffered\nevents by calling `delayedStream.resume()`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar delayed = DelayedStream.create(req);\n\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  // Emit all buffered events and resume underlaying source\n  delayed.resume();\n}, 1000);\n```\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn order to use this meta stream properly, here are a few things you should\nknow about the implementation.\n\n### Event Buffering / Proxying\n\nAll events of the `source` stream are hijacked by overwriting the `source.emit`\nmethod. Until node implements a catch-all event listener, this is the only way.\n\nHowever, delayed-stream still continues to emit all events it captures on the\n`source`, regardless of whether you have released the delayed stream yet or\nnot.\n\nUpon creation, delayed-stream captures all `source` events and stores them in\nan internal event buffer. Once `delayedStream.release()` is called, all\nbuffered events are emitted on the `delayedStream`, and the event buffer is\ncleared. After that, delayed-stream merely acts as a proxy for the underlaying\nsource.\n\n### Error handling\n\nError events on `source` are buffered / proxied just like any other events.\nHowever, `delayedStream.create` attaches a no-op `'error'` listener to the\n`source`. This way you only have to handle errors on the `delayedStream`\nobject, rather than in two places.\n\n### Buffer limits\n\ndelayed-stream provides a `maxDataSize` property that can be used to limit\nthe amount of data being buffered. In order to protect you from bad `source`\nstreams that don't react to `source.pause()`, this feature is enabled by\ndefault.\n\n## API\n\n### DelayedStream.create(source, [options])\n\nReturns a new `delayedStream`. Available options are:\n\n* `pauseStream`\n* `maxDataSize`\n\nThe description for those properties can be found below.\n\n### delayedStream.source\n\nThe `source` stream managed by this object. This is useful if you are\npassing your `delayedStream` around, and you still want to access properties\non the `source` object.\n\n### delayedStream.pauseStream = true\n\nWhether to pause the underlaying `source` when calling\n`DelayedStream.create()`. Modifying this property afterwards has no effect.\n\n### delayedStream.maxDataSize = 1024 * 1024\n\nThe amount of data to buffer before emitting an `error`.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting `Buffer` objects, the `maxDataSize`\nrefers to bytes.\n\nIf the underlaying source is emitting JavaScript strings, the size refers to\ncharacters.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can set this property to `Infinity` to\ndisable this feature. You can also modify this property during runtime.\n\n### delayedStream.dataSize = 0\n\nThe amount of data buffered so far.\n\n### delayedStream.readable\n\nAn ECMA5 getter that returns the value of `source.readable`.\n\n### delayedStream.resume()\n\nIf the `delayedStream` has not been released so far, `delayedStream.release()`\nis called.\n\nIn either case, `source.resume()` is called.\n\n### delayedStream.pause()\n\nCalls `source.pause()`.\n\n### delayedStream.pipe(dest)\n\nCalls `delayedStream.resume()` and then proxies the arguments to `source.pipe`.\n\n### delayedStream.release()\n\nEmits and clears all events that have been buffered up so far. This does not\nresume the underlaying source, use `delayedStream.resume()` instead.\n\n## License\n\ndelayed-stream is licensed under the MIT license.\n","homepage":"https://github.com/felixge/node-delayed-stream","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/felixge/node-delayed-stream/issues"},"readmeFilename":"Readme.md","contributors":[{"name":"Mike Atkins","email":"apeherder@gmail.com"}],"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"3R3PDLMYOHW7LS95R001QU3HH\"","_cached":true}
