[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SBoudrias/readline2.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SBoudrias/readline2)\n=========\n\nNode.js (v0.8 and v0.10) had some bugs and issues with the default [Readline](http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html) module.\n\nThis module include fixes seen in later version (0.11-0.12 and iojs) and ease some undesirable behavior one could see using the readline to create interatives prompts. This means `readline2` change some behaviors and as so is **not** meant to be an exact drop-in replacement.\n\nThis project is extracted from the core of [Inquirer.js interactive prompt interface](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js) to be available as a standalone module.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n**Installation**: `npm install --save readline2`\n\n### readline2.createInterface(options); -> {Interface}\n\nPresent the same API as [Node.js `readline.createInterface()`](http://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)\n\n#### Improvements\n- Default `options.input` as `process.stdin`\n- Default `options.output` as `process.stdout`\n- `interface.stdout` is wrapped in a [MuteStream](https://github.com/isaacs/mute-stream)\n- Prevent `up` and `down` keys from moving through history inside the readline\n- Fix cursor position after a line refresh when the `Interface` prompt contains ANSI colors\n- Correctly return the cursor position when faced with implicit line returns\n\n\nLicense\n-------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Simon Boudrias (twitter: [@vaxilart](https://twitter.com/Vaxilart))\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"sboudrias","email":"admin@simonboudrias.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2015-07-17T07:05:50.142Z","created":"2014-02-01T05:17:15.686Z","0.1.0":"2014-02-01T05:17:15.686Z","0.1.1":"2015-01-21T06:55:37.493Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-17T07:03:39.683Z","1.0.1":"2015-07-17T07:05:50.142Z"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/sboudrias/readline2#readme","keywords":["cli","terminal","readline","tty","ansi"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/sboudrias/readline2.git"},"author":{"name":"Simon Boudrias","email":"admin@simonboudrias.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sboudrias/readline2/issues"},"license":"MIT","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5RNSSOEQU7AFOKPK77IF7645M\""}
