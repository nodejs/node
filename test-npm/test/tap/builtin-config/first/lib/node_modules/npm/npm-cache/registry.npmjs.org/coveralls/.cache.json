Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Coverage Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Codeship Build Status][codeship-image]][codeship-url]\n[![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/nickmerwin/node-coveralls/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/nickmerwin/node-coveralls)\n\n[Coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io/) support for node.js.  Get the great coverage reporting of coveralls.io and add a cool coverage button ( like the one above ) to your README.\n\nSupported CI services:  [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/), [codeship](https://www.codeship.io/), [circleci](https://circleci.com/), [jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/), [Gitlab CI](http://gitlab.com/)\n\n##Installation:\nAdd the latest version of `coveralls` to your package.json:\n```\nnpm install coveralls --save-dev\n```\n\nIf you're using mocha, add `mocha-lcov-reporter` to your package.json:\n```\nnpm install mocha-lcov-reporter --save-dev\n```\n\n##Usage:\n\nThis script ( `bin/coveralls.js` ) can take standard input from any tool that emits the lcov data format (including [mocha](http://mochajs.org/)'s [LCov reporter](https://npmjs.org/package/mocha-lcov-reporter)) and send it to coveralls.io to report your code coverage there.\n\nOnce your app is instrumented for coverage, and building, you need to pipe the lcov output to `./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js`.\n\nThis library currently supports [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/) with no extra effort beyond piping the lcov output to coveralls. However, if you're using a different build system, there are a few environment variables that are necessary:\n* COVERALLS_SERVICE_NAME  (the name of your build system)\n* COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN (the secret repo token from coveralls.io)\n\nThere are optional environment variables for other build systems as well:\n* COVERALLS_SERVICE_JOB_ID  (an id that uniquely identifies the build job)\n* COVERALLS_RUN_AT  (a date string for the time that the job ran.  RFC 3339 dates work.  This defaults to your\nbuild system's date/time if you don't set it.)\n* COVERALLS_PARALLEL (more info here: https://coveralls.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203484329)\n\n### [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) + [Blanket.js](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket)\n- Install [blanket.js](http://blanketjs.org/)\n- Configure blanket according to [docs](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_node.md).\n- Run your tests with a command like this:\n\n```sh\nNODE_ENV=test YOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE=1 ./node_modules/.bin/mocha \\\n  --require blanket \\\n  --reporter mocha-lcov-reporter | ./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js\n```\n### [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) + [JSCoverage](https://github.com/fishbar/jscoverage)\n\nInstrumenting your app for coverage is probably harder than it needs to be (read [here](http://www.seejohncode.com/2012/03/13/setting-up-mocha-jscoverage/)), but that's also a necessary step.\n\nIn mocha, if you've got your code instrumented for coverage, the command for a travis build would look something like this:\n```sh\nYOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE=1 ./node_modules/.bin/mocha test -R mocha-lcov-reporter | ./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js\n```\nCheck out an example [Makefile](https://github.com/cainus/urlgrey/blob/master/Makefile) from one of my projects for an example, especially the test-coveralls build target.  Note: Travis runs `npm test`, so whatever target you create in your Makefile must be the target that `npm test` runs (This is set in package.json's 'scripts' property).\n\n### [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul)\n\n**With Mocha:**\n\n```sh\nistanbul cover ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha --report lcovonly -- -R spec && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js && rm -rf ./coverage\n```\n\n**With Jasmine:**\n\n```sh\nistanbul cover jasmine-node --captureExceptions spec/ && cat ./coverage/lcov.info | ./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js && rm -rf ./coverage\n```\n\n### [Nodeunit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit) + [JSCoverage](https://github.com/fishbar/jscoverage)\n\nDepend on nodeunit, jscoverage and coveralls:\n\n```sh\nnpm install nodeunit jscoverage coveralls --save-dev\n```\n\nAdd a coveralls script to \"scripts\" in your `package.json`:\n\n```javascript\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"nodeunit test\",\n  \"coveralls\": \"jscoverage lib && YOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE=1 nodeunit --reporter=lcov test | coveralls\"\n}\n```\n\nEnsure your app requires instrumented code when `process.env.YOURPACKAGE_COVERAGE` variable is defined.\n\nRun your tests with a command like this:\n\n```sh\nnpm run coveralls\n```\n\nFor detailed instructions on requiring instrumented code, running on Travis and submitting to coveralls [see this guide](https://github.com/alanshaw/nodeunit-lcov-coveralls-example).\n\n### [Poncho](https://github.com/deepsweet/poncho)\nClient-side JS code coverage using [PhantomJS](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs), [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) and [Blanket](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket):\n- [Configure](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#browser-support) Mocha for browser\n- [Mark](https://github.com/deepsweet/poncho#usage) target script(s) with `data-cover` html-attribute\n- Run your tests with a command like this:\n\n```sh\n./node_modules/.bin/poncho -R lcov test/test.html | ./node_modules/coveralls/bin/coveralls.js\n```\n\n### [Lab](https://github.com/hapijs/lab)\n```sh\nlab -r lcov | ./node_modules/.bin/coveralls\n```\n\n### [nyc](https://github.com/bcoe/nyc)\n\nworks with almost any testing framework. Simply execute\n`npm test` with the `nyc` bin followed by running its reporter:\n\n```\nnyc npm test && nyc report --reporter=text-lcov | coveralls\n```\n\n### [TAP](https://github.com/isaacs/node-tap)\n\nSimply run your tap tests with the `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` environment\nvariable set and tap will automatically use `nyc` to report\ncoverage to coveralls.\n\n### Command Line Parameters\nUsage: coveralls.js [-v] filepath\n\n#### Optional arguments:\n\n-v, --verbose\n\nfilepath - optionally defines the base filepath of your source files.\n\n## Running locally\n\nIf you're running locally, you must have a `.coveralls.yml` file, as documented in [their documentation](https://coveralls.io/docs/ruby), with your `repo_token` in it; or, you must provide a `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` environment-variable on the command-line.\n\nIf you want to send commit data to coveralls, you can set the `COVERALLS_GIT_COMMIT` environment-variable to the commit hash you wish to reference. If you don't want to use a hash, you can set it to `HEAD` to supply coveralls with the latest commit data. This requires git to be installed and executable on the current PATH.\n\n[travis-image]: https://travis-ci.org/nickmerwin/node-coveralls.svg?branch=master\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/nickmerwin/node-coveralls\n\n[codeship-image]: https://www.codeship.io/projects/de6fb440-dea9-0130-e7d9-122ca7ee39d3/status\n[codeship-url]: https://www.codeship.io/projects/5622\n\n[coveralls-image]: https://coveralls.io/repos/nickmerwin/node-coveralls/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/github/nickmerwin/node-coveralls?branch=master\n\n## Contributing\n\nI generally don't accept pull requests that are untested, or break the build, because I'd like to keep the quality high (this is a coverage tool afterall!).\n\nI also don't care for \"soft-versioning\" or \"optimistic versioning\" (dependencies that have ^, x, > in them, or anything other than numbers and dots).  There have been too many problems with bad semantic versioning in dependencies, and I'd rather have a solid library than a bleeding edge one.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"cainus","email":"gregg@caines.ca"},{"name":"nickmerwin","email":"n@mer.fm"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-09-19T16:30:57.663Z","created":"2013-03-15T03:19:16.470Z","1.0.0":"2013-03-15T03:19:17.963Z","1.1.0":"2013-03-21T13:57:53.990Z","1.1.1":"2013-03-23T16:10:26.087Z","1.1.2":"2013-03-24T01:35:04.334Z","1.1.3":"2013-03-24T02:37:25.943Z","2.0.0":"2013-03-28T06:48:27.750Z","2.0.1":"2013-03-28T07:27:16.263Z","2.0.2":"2013-03-28T07:39:50.488Z","2.0.3":"2013-03-28T07:48:05.803Z","2.0.4":"2013-03-28T08:05:15.223Z","2.0.5":"2013-03-28T18:50:51.658Z","2.0.6":"2013-04-08T03:20:09.624Z","2.0.7":"2013-04-15T18:53:05.206Z","2.0.8":"2013-05-24T19:37:52.060Z","2.0.9":"2013-05-24T20:03:16.595Z","2.0.10":"2013-06-03T03:48:42.605Z","2.0.11":"2013-06-03T05:47:25.850Z","2.0.12":"2013-06-03T05:57:26.203Z","2.0.13":"2013-06-08T18:42:36.499Z","2.0.15":"2013-06-22T21:43:57.990Z","2.0.16":"2013-06-22T22:52:08.903Z","2.1.0":"2013-07-30T19:11:13.234Z","2.2.0":"2013-08-25T03:59:49.679Z","2.3.0":"2013-09-07T15:33:05.176Z","2.5.0":"2013-11-23T16:30:26.983Z","2.6.0":"2013-12-06T05:54:45.870Z","2.6.1":"2013-12-21T16:58:51.499Z","2.7.0":"2014-01-27T17:24:20.718Z","2.7.1":"2014-02-03T13:31:12.313Z","2.8.0":"2014-02-13T00:03:41.081Z","2.10.0":"2014-03-18T01:52:28.865Z","2.10.1":"2014-06-22T15:22:00.708Z","2.11.0":"2014-07-03T17:33:53.309Z","2.11.1":"2014-07-07T17:22:56.892Z","2.11.2":"2014-09-22T02:05:35.871Z","2.11.3":"2015-07-18T17:16:45.157Z","2.11.4":"2015-08-13T03:41:50.729Z","2.11.5":"2015-12-10T20:59:20.036Z","2.11.6":"2015-12-11T01:05:41.592Z","2.11.7":"2016-02-26T19:13:45.513Z","2.11.8":"2016-02-26T19:22:06.549Z","2.11.9":"2016-03-25T03:23:30.537Z","2.11.10":"2016-07-12T17:46:16.373Z","2.11.11":"2016-07-12T17:47:08.954Z","2.11.12":"2016-07-27T23:45:55.834Z","2.11.13":"2016-09-15T17:17:41.749Z","2.11.14":"2016-09-19T16:30:57.663Z"},"author":{"name":"Gregg Caines"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/nickmerwin/node-coveralls.git"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/nickmerwin/node-coveralls#readme","keywords":["coverage","coveralls"],"contributors":[{"name":"Gregg Caines","email":"gregg@caines.ca","url":"http://caines.ca"},{"name":"Joshua Ma","email":"github@joshma.com","url":"http://joshma.com"},{"name":"Alan Gutierrez","email":"alan@prettyrobots.com","url":"http://www.prettyrobots.com/"},{"name":"Kir Belevich","url":"https://github.com/svg"},{"name":"elliotcable","email":"github@elliottcable.name","url":"http://elliottcable.name/"},{"name":"Slotos","email":"slotos@gmail.com","url":"http://slotos.net"},{"name":"mattjmorrison","email":"mattjmorrison@mattjmorrison.com","url":"http://mattjmorrison.com"},{"name":"Arpad Borsos","email":"arpad.borsos@googlemail.com","url":"http://swatinem.de/"},{"name":"Adam Moss","url":"https://github.com/adam-moss"}],"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nickmerwin/node-coveralls/issues"},"license":"BSD-2-Clause","users":{"afc163":true,"t1st3":true,"kabomi":true,"zhangyaochun":true,"nadimix":true,"rizowski":true,"markthethomas":true,"nickmerwin":true,"abhisekp":true,"starver":true,"brad-christie":true,"honzajde":true,"jclo":true,"silentcloud":true,"gr2m":true,"jessaustin":true,"moosecouture":true,"fhinkel":true,"sejoker":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"1T1JSIOCP4LFGSWDW8WQH2JX3\""}
