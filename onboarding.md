# Onboarding

This document is an outline of the things we tell new collaborators at their
onboarding session.

## One week before the onboarding session

* If the new Collaborator is not yet a member of the nodejs GitHub organization,
  confirm that they are using [two-factor authentication][]. It will not be
  possible to add them to the organization if they are not using two-factor
  authentication. If they cannot receive SMS messages from GitHub, try
  [using a TOTP mobile app][].
* Suggest the new Collaborator install [`@node-core/utils`][] and
  [set up the credentials][] for it.

## Fifteen minutes before the onboarding session

* Prior to the onboarding session, add the new Collaborator to
  [the collaborators team](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/collaborators).
* Ask them if they want to join any [subsystem teams](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/core/teams)
  and add them accordingly. See [Who to CC in the issue tracker][who-to-cc].

## Onboarding session

* This session will cover:
  * [local setup](#local-setup)
  * [project goals and values](#project-goals-and-values)
  * [managing the issue tracker](#managing-the-issue-tracker)
  * [reviewing pull requests](#reviewing-pull-requests)
  * [landing pull requests](#landing-pull-requests)

## Local setup

* git:
  * Make sure you have whitespace=fix: `git config --global --add
    apply.whitespace fix`
  * Always create a branch in your own GitHub fork for pull requests
    * Branches in the `nodejs/node` repository are only for release lines
  * Add the canonical nodejs repository as `upstream` remote:
    * `git remote add upstream git@github.com:nodejs/node.git`
  * To update from `upstream`:
    * `git checkout main`
    * `git fetch upstream HEAD`
    * `git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`
  * Make a new branch for each pull request you submit.
  * Membership: Consider making your membership in the Node.js GitHub
    organization public. This makes it easier to identify collaborators.
    Instructions on how to do that are available at
    [Publicizing or hiding organization membership][].

* Notifications:
  * Use <https://github.com/notifications> or
    set up email
  * Watching the main repository will flood your inbox (several hundred
    notifications on typical weekdays), so be prepared
  * Watching the discussions in the
    [collaborators repo](https://github.com/nodejs/collaborators) is recommended.

The project has a venue for real-time discussion:

* [`#nodejs-core`](https://openjs-foundation.slack.com/archives/C019Y2T6STH) on
  the [OpenJS Foundation Slack](https://slack-invite.openjsf.org/)

## Project goals and values

* Collaborators are the collective owners of the project
  * The project has the goals of its contributors

* There are some higher-level goals and values
  * Empathy towards users matters (this is in part why we onboard people)
  * Generally: try to be nice to people!
  * The best outcome is for people who come to our issue tracker to feel like
    they can come back again.

* You are expected to follow _and_ hold others accountable to the
  [Code of Conduct][].

## Managing the issue tracker

* You have (mostly) free rein; don't hesitate to close an issue if you are
  confident that it should be closed.
  * Be nice about closing issues! Let people know why, and that issues and pull
    requests can be reopened if necessary.

* See [Labels][].
  * There is [a bot](https://github.com/nodejs-github-bot/github-bot) that
    applies subsystem labels (for example, `doc`, `test`, `assert`, or `buffer`)
    so that we know what parts of the code base the pull request modifies. It is
    not perfect, of course. Feel free to apply relevant labels and remove
    irrelevant labels from pull requests and issues.
  * `semver-{minor,major}`:
    * If a change has the remote _chance_ of breaking something, use the
      `semver-major` label
    * When adding a `semver-*` label, add a comment explaining why you're adding
      it. Do it right away so you don't forget!
  * Please add the [`author-ready`][] label for pull requests, if applicable.

* See [Who to CC in the issue tracker][who-to-cc].
  * This will come more naturally over time
  * For many of the teams listed there, you can ask to be added if you are
    interested
    * Some are WGs with some process around adding people, others are only there
      for notifications

* When a discussion gets heated, you can request that other collaborators keep
  an eye on it by opening an issue at the private
  [nodejs/moderation](https://github.com/nodejs/moderation) repository. Note
  that while that repository is not public, it can be accessed by anyone in the
  nodejs org, so refrain from using it to report individuals (reporting
  spam/bots there is fine of course).
  * This is a repository to which all members of the `nodejs` GitHub
    organization (not just collaborators on Node.js core) have access. Its
    contents should not be shared externally.
  * Node.js has a moderation team which you should contact when unsure
    about taking action in the Node.js org.
  * You can moderate non-collaborator posts yourself. Please
    report the moderation action taken in accordance to the moderation
    policy.
  * You can always refer to the
    [full moderation policy](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/main/Moderation-Policy.md).
  * You can contact someone in the
    [full list of moderation team members](https://github.com/nodejs/admin/blob/main/Moderation-Policy.md#current-members-of-moderation-team).

## Reviewing pull requests

* The primary goal is for the codebase to improve.

* Secondary (but not far off) is for the person submitting code to succeed. A
  pull request from a new contributor is an opportunity to grow the community.

* Review a bit at a time. Do not overwhelm new contributors.
  * It is tempting to micro-optimize. Don't succumb to that temptation. We
    change V8 often. Techniques that provide improved performance today may be
    unnecessary in the future.

* Be aware: Your opinion carries a lot of weight!

* Nits (requests for small changes that are not essential) are fine, but try to
  avoid stalling the pull request.
  * Identify them as nits when you comment: `Nit: change foo() to bar().`
  * If they are stalling the pull request, fix them yourself on merge.

* Insofar as possible, issues should be identified by tools rather than human
  reviewers. If you are leaving comments about issues that could be identified
  by tools but are not, consider implementing the necessary tooling.

* Minimum wait for comments time
  * There is a minimum waiting time which we try to respect for non-trivial
    changes so that people who may have important input in such a distributed
    project are able to respond.
  * For non-trivial changes, leave the pull request open for at least 48 hours.
  * If a pull request is abandoned, check if they'd mind if you took it over
    (especially if it just has nits left).

* Approving a change
  * Collaborators indicate that they have reviewed and approve of the changes in
    a pull request using GitHub's approval interface
  * Some people like to comment `LGTM` (“Looks Good To Me”)
  * You have the authority to approve any other collaborator's work.
  * You cannot approve your own pull requests.
  * When explicitly using `Changes requested`, show empathy – comments will
    usually be addressed even if you don't use it.
    * If you do, it is nice if you are available later to check whether your
      comments have been addressed
    * If you see that the requested changes have been made, you can clear
      another collaborator's `Changes requested` review.
    * Use `Changes requested` to indicate that you are considering some of your
      comments to block the pull request from landing.

* What belongs in Node.js:
  * Opinions vary – it's good to have a broad collaborator base for that reason!
  * If Node.js itself needs it (due to historical reasons), then it belongs in
    Node.js.
    * That is to say, `url` is there because of `http`, `freelist` is there
      because of `http`, etc.
  * Things that cannot be done outside of core, or only with significant pain
    such as `async_hooks`.

* Continuous Integration (CI) Testing:
  * <https://ci.nodejs.org/>
    * It is not automatically run. You need to start it manually.
  * Log in on CI is integrated with GitHub. Try to log in now!
  * You will be using `node-test-pull-request` most of the time. Go there now!
    * Consider bookmarking it: <https://ci.nodejs.org/job/node-test-pull-request/>
  * To get to the form to start a job, click on `Build with Parameters`. (If you
    don't see it, that probably means you are not logged in!) Click it now!
  * To start CI testing from this screen, you need to fill in two elements on
    the form:
    * The `CERTIFY_SAFE` box should be checked. By checking it, you are
      indicating that you have reviewed the code you are about to test and you
      are confident that it does not contain any malicious code. (We don't want
      people hijacking our CI hosts to attack other hosts on the internet, for
      example!)
    * The `PR_ID` box should be filled in with the number identifying the pull
      request containing the code you wish to test. For example, if the URL for
      the pull request is `https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7006`, then put
      `7006` in the `PR_ID`.
    * The remaining elements on the form are typically unchanged.
  * If you need help with something CI-related:
    * Use the [Build WG repository](https://github.com/nodejs/build) to file
      issues for the Build WG members who maintain the CI infrastructure.

## Landing pull requests

See the Collaborator Guide: [Landing pull requests][].

Commits in one pull request that belong to one logical change should
be squashed. It is rarely the case in onboarding exercises, so this
needs to be pointed out separately during the onboarding.

<!-- TODO(joyeechueng): provide examples about "one logical change" -->

## Exercise: Make a pull request adding yourself to the README

* Example:
  <https://github.com/nodejs/node/commit/6669b3857f0f43ee0296eb7ac45086cd907b9e94>
  * For raw commit message:
    `git show --format=%B 6669b3857f0f43ee0296eb7ac45086cd907b9e94`
* Collaborators are in alphabetical order by GitHub username.
* Optionally, include your personal pronouns.
* Commit, including a `Fixes: <collaborator-nomination-issue-url>` trailer
  so that when the commit lands, the nomination issue url will be
  automatically closed.
* Run `tools/find-inactive-collaborators.mjs`. If that command outputs your name,
  amend the commit to include an addition to the [mailmap](.mailmap) file. See
  [gitmailmap](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitmailmap) for information on the
  format of the mailmap file.
* Push the commit to your own fork.
* Label your pull request with the `doc`, `notable-change`, and `fast-track`
  labels. The `fast-track` label should cause the Node.js GitHub bot to post a
  comment in the pull request asking collaborators to approve the pull request
  by leaving a 👍 reaction on the comment.
* Optional: Run CI on the pull request. Use the `node-test-pull-request` CI
  task. As a convenience, you may apply the `request-ci` label to the pull
  request to have a GitHub Actions workflow start the Jenkins CI task for you.
* After two Collaborator approvals for the change and two Collaborator approvals
  for fast-tracking, land the PR.
* If there are not enough approvals within a reasonable time, consider the
  single approval of the onboarding TSC member sufficient, and land the pull
  request.
  * Be sure to add the `PR-URL: <full-pr-url>` and appropriate `Reviewed-By:`
    metadata.
  * [`@node-core/utils`][] automates the generation of metadata and the landing
    process. See the documentation of [`git-node`][].
  * [`core-validate-commit`][] automates the validation of commit messages.
    This will be run during `git node land --final` of the [`git-node`][]
    command.

## Final notes

* Don't worry about making mistakes: everybody makes them, there's a lot to
  internalize and that takes time (and we recognize that!)
* Almost any mistake you could make can be fixed or reverted.
* The existing collaborators trust you and are grateful for your help!
* Other repositories:
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/TSC>
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/build>
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org>
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/Release>
  * <https://github.com/nodejs/citgm>
* The OpenJS Foundation hosts regular summits for active contributors to the
  Node.js project, where we have face-to-face discussions about our work on the
  project. The Foundation has travel funds to cover [participants' expenses][]
  including accommodations and transportation if needed. Check out
  the [summit](https://github.com/nodejs/summit) repository for details.
