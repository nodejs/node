- fix tests for NODE_MODULE_CONTEXTS=1
- readline
  - fix for two column glyphs. use Markus Kuhn's wcwidth.c
  - fix for commands that extend beyond term width
- SSL should be factored out of net.js into standalone stream object
- add completion callbacks to all stream write() methods
- Erradicate all traces of 'binary' encoding. Only used, now, in OpenSSL
  binding.
- EventSource branch merged
- Use C++ style casts everywhere.
- Ruby-like Process#detach (is that possible?)
- stderr isn't flushing on exit
- ReadStream should not use an offset in calls to fs.read
  (so that it can pull in files larger than 2G)
- process object should be defined in src/node.js not in c++
- Test for EMFILE accept spin bug.
- Deprecate setEncoding() and instead add option to on('data').
  Example:

    stdin.on('data', { encoding: 'utf8' }, function (chunk) {
      process.stdout.write('WRITE: ' + chunk);
    });

  Perhaps by assigning cb.opts.encoding and calling
  EventEmitter.optHandlers.encoding() if it exists.

- DOCS
  - Fix examples using leading comma style. EG
    http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/fs.html#fs.stat
  - Remove jquery
  - anchor links next to each function, for easy linking.
    EG <a href="#fs.stat">#</a>
