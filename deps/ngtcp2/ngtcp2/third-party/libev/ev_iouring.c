/*
 * general notes about linux io_uring:
 *
 * a) it's the best interface I have seen so far. on linux.
 * b) best is not necessarily very good.
 * c) it's better than the aio mess, doesn't suffer from the fork problems
 *    of linux aio or epoll and so on and so on. and you could do event stuff
 *    without any syscalls. what's not to like?
 * d) ok, it's vastly more complex, but that's ok, really.
 * e) why two mmaps instead of one? one would be more space-efficient,
 *    and I can't see what benefit two would have (other than being
 *    somehow resizable/relocatable, but that's apparently not possible).
 * f) hmm, it's practically undebuggable (gdb can't access the memory, and
 *    the bizarre way structure offsets are communicated makes it hard to
 *    just print the ring buffer heads, even *iff* the memory were visible
 *    in gdb. but then, that's also ok, really.
 * g) well, you cannot specify a timeout when waiting for events. no,
 *    seriously, the interface doesn't support a timeout. never seen _that_
 *    before. sure, you can use a timerfd, but that's another syscall
 *    you could have avoided. overall, this bizarre omission smells
 *    like a Âµ-optimisation by the io_uring author for his personal
 *    applications, to the detriment of everybody else who just wants
 *    an event loop. but, umm, ok, if that's all, it could be worse.
 *    (from what I gather from the author Jens Axboe, it simply didn't
 *    occur to him, and he made good on it by adding an unlimited nuber
 *    of timeouts later :).
 * h) initially there was a hardcoded limit of 4096 outstanding events.
 *    later versions not only bump this to 32k, but also can handle
 *    an unlimited amount of events, so this only affects the batch size.
 * i) unlike linux aio, you *can* register more then the limit
 *    of fd events. while early verisons of io_uring signalled an overflow
 *    and you ended up getting wet. 5.5+ does not do this anymore.
 * j) but, oh my! it had exactly the same bugs as the linux aio backend,
 *    where some undocumented poll combinations just fail. fortunately,
 *    after finally reaching the author, he was more than willing to fix
 *    this probably in 5.6+.
 * k) overall, the *API* itself is, I dare to say, not a total trainwreck.
 *    once the bugs ae fixed (probably in 5.6+), it will be without
 *    competition.
