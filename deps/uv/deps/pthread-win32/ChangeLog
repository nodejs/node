2011-07-06  Ross Johnson <ross dot johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* pthread_cond_wait.c (pragma inline_depth): this is almost redundant
	now nevertheless fixed thei controlling MSC_VER from "< 800" to
	"< 1400" (i.e. any prior to VC++ 8.0).
	* pthread_once.ci (pragma inline_depth): Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock.ci (pragma inline_depth): Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlock_wrlock.ci (pragma inline_depth): Likewise.
	* sem_timedwait.ci (pragma inline_depth): Likewise.
	* sem_wait.ci (pragma inline_depth): Likewise.

2011-07-05  Ross Johnson <ross dot johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c: Use strncat_s if available
	to removei a compile warning; MingW supports this routine but we
	continue to use strncat anyway there because it is secure if
	given the correct parameters; fix strncat param 3 to avoid
	buffer overrun exploitation potential.

2011-07-03  Ross Johnson <ross dot johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* pthread_spin_unlock.c (EPERM): Return success if unlocking a lock
	that is not locked, because single CPU machines wrap a
	PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL mutex, which returns success in this case.
	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c (QUSEREX.DLL): Load from an
	absolute path only which must be the Windows System folder.

2011-07-03 Daniel Richard G. <skunk at iskunk dot org>

	* Makefile (_WIN32_WINNT): Removed; duplicate definition in
	implement.h; more cleanup and enhancements.

2011-07-02 Daniel Richard G. <skunk at iskunk dot org>

	* Makefile: Cleanups and implovements.
	* ptw32_MCS_locks.c: Casting fixes.
	* implement.h: Interlocked call and argument casting macro fixes
	to support older and newer build environments.

2011-07-01  Ross Johnson <ross dot johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* *.[ch] (PTW32_INTERLOCKED_*): Redo 23 and 64 bit versions of these
	macros and re-apply in code to undo the incorrect changes from
	2011-06-29; remove some size_t casts which should not be required
	and may be problematic.a
	There are now two sets of macros:
	PTW32_INTERLOCKED_*_LONG which work only on 32 bit integer variables;
	PTW32_INTERLOCKED_*_SIZE which work on size_t integer variables, i.e.
	LONG for 32 bit systems and LONGLONG for 64 bit systems.
	* implement.h (MCS locks): nextFlag and waitFlag are now HANDLE type.
	* ptw32_MCS_locks.c: Likewise.
	* pthread.h (#include <setjmp.h>): Removed.
	* ptw32_throw.c (#include <setjmp.h>): Added.
	* ptw32_threadStart.c (#include <setjmp.h>): Added.
	* implement.h (#include <setjmp.h>): Added.

2011-06-30  Ross Johnson <ross dot johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* pthread_once.c: Tighten 'if' statement casting; fix interlocked
	pointer cast for 64 bit compatibility (missed yesterday); remove
	the superfluous static cleanup routine and call the release routine
	directly if popped.
	* create.c (stackSize): Now type size_t.
	* pthread.h (struct ptw32_thread_t_): Rearrange to fix element alignments.

2011-06-29 Daniel Richard G. <skunk at iskunk dot org>

	* ptw32_relmillisecs.c (ftime):
	  _ftime64_s() is only available in MSVC 2005 or later;
	  _ftime64() is available in MinGW or MSVC 2002 or later;
	  _ftime() is always available.
	* pthread.h (long long): Not defined in older MSVC 6.
	* implement.h (long long): Likewise.
	* pthread_getunique_np.c (long long): Likewise.

2011-06-29  Ross Johnson <ross dot johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* *.[ch] (PTW32_INTERLOCKED_*): These macros should now work for
	both 32 and 64 bit builds. The MingW versions are all inlined asm
	while the MSVC versions expand to their Interlocked* or Interlocked*64
	counterparts appropriately. The argument type have also been changed
	to cast to the appropriate value or pointer size for the architecture.

2011-05-29  Ross Johnson <ross dot johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* *.[ch] (#ifdef): Extended cleanup to whole project.

2011-05-29 Daniel Richard G. <skunk at iskunk dot org>

	* Makefile (CC): Define  CC to allow use of other compatible
	compilers such as the Intel compilter icl.
	* implement.h (#if): Fix forms like #if HAVE_SOMETHING.
	* pthread.h: Likewise.
	* sched.h: Likewise; PTW32_LEVEL_* becomes PTW32_SCHED_LEVEL_*.
	* semaphore.h: Likewise.

2011-05-11  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* ptw32_callUserDestroyRoutines.c (terminate): Altered includes
	to match ptw32_threadStart.c.
	* GNUmakefile (GCE-inlined-debug, DOPT): Fixed.

2011-04-31  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* (robust mutexes): Added this API. The API is not
	mandatory for implementations that don't support PROCESS_SHARED
	mutexes, nevertheless it was considered useful both functionally
	and for source-level compatibility.
	
2011-03-26  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* pthread_getunique_np.c: New non-POSIX interface for compatibility
	with some other implementations; returns a 64 bit sequence number
	that is unique to each thread in the process.
	* pthread.h (pthread_getunique_np): Added.
	* global.c: Add global sequence counter for above.
	* implement.h: Likewise.

	* pthread_mutex*.c: First working robust mutexes.

2011-03-11  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* implement.h (PTW32_INTERLOCKED_*CREMENT macros): increment/decrement
	using ++/-- instead of add/subtract 1.
	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c: Make casts consistent.

2011-03-09  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* implement.h (ptw32_thread_t_): Add process unique sequence number.
	* global.c: Replace global Critical Section objects with MCS
	queue locks.

	* ptw32_spinlock_check_need_init.c: Likewise.

2011-03-06  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* several (MINGW64): Cast and call fixups for 64 bit compatibility;
	clean build via x86_64-w64-mingw32 cross toolchain on Linux i686
	targeting x86_64 win64.
	* ptw32_threadStart.c (ptw32_threadStart): Routine no longer attempts
	to pass [unexpected C++] exceptions out of scope but ends the thread
	normally setting EINTR as the exit status.
	* ptw32_throw.c: Fix C++ exception throwing warnings; ignore
	informational warning.
	* implement.h: Likewise with the corresponding header definition.

2011-03-04  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* implement.h (PTW32_INTERLOCKED_*): Mingw32 does not provide
	the __sync_* intrinsics so implemented them here as macro
	assembler routines. MSVS Interlocked* are emmitted as intrinsics
	wherever possible, so we want mingw to match it; Extended to
	include all interlocked routines used by the library; implemented
	x86_64 versions also.
	* ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange.c: No code remaining here.
	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c: Converted interlocked calls to use new macros.
	* pthread_barrier_wait.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_once.c: Likewise.
	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c (ptw32_mcs_node_substitute): Name changed to
	ptw32_mcs_node_transfer.

2011-02-28  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* ptw32_relmillisecs.c: If possible, use _ftime64_s or _ftime64
	before resorting to _ftime.

2011-02-27  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* sched_setscheduler.c: Ensure the handle is closed after use.
	* sched_getscheduler.c: Likewise.
	* pthread.h: Remove POSIX compatibility macros; don't define
	timespec if already defined.
	* context.h: Changes for 64 bit.
	* pthread_cancel.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_exit.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_spin_destroy.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_timechange_handler_np.c: Likewise.
	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c: Likewise; some of these changes may
	not be compatible with pre Windows 2000 systems; reverse the order of
	the includes.
	* ptw32_threadStart.c: Likewise.
	* ptw32_throw.c: Likewise.

2011-02-13  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* pthread_self: Add comment re returning 'nil' value to
	indicate failure only to win32 threads that call us.
	* pthread_attr_setstackaddr: Fix comments; note this
	function and it's compliment are now removed from SUSv4.

2011-02-12  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	README.NONPORTABLE: Record a description of an obvious
	method for nulling/comparing/hashing pthread_t using a
	union; plus and investigation of a change of type for
	pthread_t (to a union) to neutralise any padding bits and
	bytes if they occur in pthread_t (the current pthread_t struct
	does not contain padding AFAIK, but porting the library to a
	future architecture may introduce them). Padding affects
	byte-by-byte copies and compare operations.

2010-11-16  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* ChangeLog: Add this entry ;-)
	Restore entries from 2007 through 2009 that went missing
	at the last update.

2010-06-19  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c (ptw32_mcs_node_substitute): Fix variable
	names to avoid using C++ keyword ("new").
	* implement.h (ptw32_mcs_node_substitute): Likewise.
	* pthread_barrier_wait.c: Fix signed/unsigned comparison warning.

2010-06-18  Ramiro Polla  <ramiro.polla at gmail.com >

	* autostatic.c: New file; call pthread_win32_process_*()
	libary init/cleanup routines automatically on application start
	when statically linked.
	* pthread.c (autostatic.c): Included.
	* pthread.h (declspec): Remove import/export defines if compiler
	is MINGW.
	* sched.h (declspec): Likewise.
	* semaphore.h (declspec): Likewise.
	* need_errno.h (declspec): Likewise.
	* Makefile (autostatic.obj): Add for small static builds.
	* GNUmakefile (autostatic.o): Likewise.
	* NEWS (Version 2.9.0): Add changes.
	* README.NONPORTABLE (pthread_win32_process_*): Update
	description.

2010-06-15  Ramiro Polla  <ramiro.polla at gmail.com >

	* Makefile: Remove linkage with the winsock library by default.
	* GNUmakefile: Likewise.
	* pthread_getspecific.c: Likewise by removing calls to WSA
	functions.
	* config.h (RETAIN_WSALASTERROR): Can be defined if necessary.

2010-01-26  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c (ptw32_mcs_node_substitute): New routine
	to allow relocating the lock owners thread-local node to somewhere
	else, e.g. to global space so that another thread can release the
	lock. Used in pthread_barrier_wait.
	(ptw32_mcs_lock_try_acquire): New routine.
	* pthread_barrier_init: Only one semaphore is used now.
	* pthread_barrier_wait: Added an MCS guard lock with the last thread
	to leave the barrier releasing the lock. This removes a deadlock bug
	observed when there are greater than barrier-count threads
	attempting to cross.
	* pthread_barrier_destroy: Added an MCS guard lock.
        
2009-03-03  Stephan O'Farrill <stephan dot ofarrill at gmail dot com>

	* pthread_attr_getschedpolicy.c: Add "const" to function parameter
	in accordance with SUSv3 (POSIX).
	* pthread_attr_getinheritsched.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_mutexattr_gettype.c: Likewise.

2008-06-06  Robert Kindred  <RKindred at SwRI dot edu>

	* ptw32_throw.c (ptw32_throw): Remove possible reference to NULL
	pointer. (At the same time made the switch block conditionally
	included only if exitCode is needed - RPJ.)
	* pthread_testcancel.c (pthread_testcancel): Remove duplicate and
	misplaced pthread_mutex_unlock().

2008-02-21  Sebastian Gottschalk  <seppig_relay at gmx dot de>

	* pthread_attr_getdetachstate.c (pthread_attr_getdetachstate):
	Remove potential and superfluous null pointer assignment.

2007-11-22  Ivan Pizhenko  <ivanp4 at ua dot fm>

	* pthread.h (gmtime_r): gmtime returns 0 if tm represents a time
	prior to 1/1/1970. Notice this to prevent raising an exception.
	* pthread.h (localtime_r): Likewise for localtime.

2007-07-14  Marcel Ruff  <mr at marcelruff dot info>

	* errno.c (_errno): Fix test for pthread_self() success.
	* need_errno.h: Remove unintentional line wrap from #if line.

2007-07-14  Mike Romanchuk  <mromanchuk at empirix dot com>

	* pthread.h (timespec): Fix tv_sec type.

2007-01-07  Sinan Kaya <sinan.kaya at siemens dot com>

	* need_errno.h: Fix declaration of _errno - the local version of
	_errno() is used, e.g. by WinCE.

2007-01-06  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* ptw32_semwait.c: Add check for invalid sem_t after acquiring the
	sem_t state guard mutex and before affecting changes to sema state.
                
2007-01-06  Marcel Ruff <mr at marcelruff dot info>

	* error.c: Fix reference to pthread handle exitStatus member for
	builds that use NEED_ERRNO (i.e. WINCE).
	* context.h: Add support for ARM processor (WinCE).
	* mutex.c (process.h): Exclude for WINCE.
	* create.c: Likewise.
	* exit.c: Likewise.
	* implement.h: Likewise.
	* pthread_detach.c (signal.h): Exclude for WINCE.
	* pthread_join.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_kill.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlock_init.c (errno.h): Remove - included by pthread.h.
	* pthread_rwlock_destroy.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlock_rdlock.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock.c: Likewise.

	* pthread_rwlockattr_destroy.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlockattr_init.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared.c: Likewise.

2007-01-06  Romano Paolo Tenca <rotenca at telvia dot it>

	* pthread_cond_destroy.c: Replace sem_wait() with non-cancelable
	ptw32_semwait() since pthread_cond_destroy() is not a cancelation
	point.
	* implement.h (ptw32_spinlock_check_need_init): Add prototype.
	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c: Reverse order of includes.

2007-01-06  Eric Berge <eric dot berge at quantum dot com>

	* pthread_cond_destroy.c: Add LeaveCriticalSection before returning
	after errors.

2007-01-04  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail dot com dot au>

	* ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange.c: Conditionally skip for
	Win64 as not required.
	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c (pthread_win32_process_attach_np):
	Test for InterlockedCompareExchange is not required for Win64.
	* context.h: New file. Included by pthread_cancel.h and any tests
	that need it (e.g. context1.c).
	* pthread_cancel.c: Architecture-dependent context macros moved
	to context.h.

2007-01-04  Kip Streithorst <KSTREITH at ball dot com>

	* implement.h (PTW32_INTERLOCKED_COMPARE_EXCHANGE): Add Win64
	support.

2006-12-20  Ross Johnson <ross.johnson at homemail.com.au>

	* sem_destroy.c: Fix the race involving invalidation of the sema;
	fix incorrect return of EBUSY resulting from the mutex trylock
	on the private mutex guard.
	* sem_wait.c: Add check for invalid sem_t after acquiring the
	sem_t state guard mutex and before affecting changes to sema state.
	* sem_trywait.c: Likewise.
	* sem_timedwait.c: Likewise.
	* sem_getvalue.c: Likewise.
	* sem_post.c: Similar.
	* sem_post_multiple.c: Likewise.
	* sem_init.c: Set max Win32 semaphore count to SEM_VALUE_MAX (was
	_POSIX_SEM_VALUE_MAX, which is a lower value - the minimum).

	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c (pthread_win32_process_attach_np):
	Load COREDLL.DLL under WINCE to check existence of
	InterlockedCompareExchange() routine. This used to be done to test
	for TryEnterCriticalSection() but was removed when this was no
	longer needed.

2006-01-25  Prashant Thakre <prashant.thakre at gmail.com>

	* pthread_cancel.c: Added _M_IA64 register context support.

2005-05-13  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_kill.c (pthread_kill): Remove check for Win32 thread
	priority (to confirm HANDLE validity). Useless since thread HANDLEs
	a not recycle-unique.

2005-05-30  Vladimir Kliatchko  <vladimir at kliatchko.com>

	* pthread_once.c: Re-implement using an MCS queue-based lock. The form
	of pthread_once is as proposed by Alexander Terekhov (see entry of
	2005-03-13). The MCS lock implementation does not require a unique
	'name' to identify the lock between threads. Attempts to get the Event
	or Semaphore based versions of pthread_once to a satisfactory level
	of robustness have thus far failed. The last problem (avoiding races
	involving non recycle-unique Win32 HANDLEs) was giving everyone
	grey hair trying to solve it.

	* ptw32_MCS_lock.c: New MCS queue-based lock implementation. These
	locks are efficient: they have very low overhead in the uncontended case;
	are efficient in contention and minimise cache-coherence updates in
	managing the user level FIFO queue; do not require an ABI change in the
	library.

2005-05-27  Alexander Gottwald <alexander.gottwald at s1999.tu-chemnitz.de>

	* pthread.h: Some things, like HANDLE, were only defined if
	PTW32_LEVEL was >= 3. They should always be defined.

2005-05-25  Vladimir Kliatchko  <vladimir at kliatchko.com>

	* pthread_once.c: Eliminate all priority operations and other
	complexity by replacing the event with a semaphore. The advantage
	of the change is the ability to release just one waiter if the
	init_routine thread is cancelled yet still release all waiters when
	done. Simplify once_control state checks to improve efficiency
	further.

2005-05-24  Mikael Magnusson  <mikaelmagnusson at glocalnet.net>

	* GNUmakefile: Patched to allow cross-compile with mingw32 on Linux.
	It uses macros instead of referencing dlltool, gcc and g++ directly;
	added a call to ranlib. For example the GC static library can be
	built with:
	make CC=i586-mingw32msvc-gcc RC=i586-mingw32msvc-windres \
	RANLIB=i586-mingw32msvc-ranlib clean GC-static

2005-05-13  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c (pthread_win32_thread_detach_np):
	Move on-exit-only stuff from ptw32_threadDestroy() to here.
	* ptw32_threadDestroy.c: It's purpose is now only to reclaim thread
	resources for detached threads, or via pthread_join() or
	pthread_detach() on joinable threads.
	* ptw32_threadStart.c: Calling user destruct routines has moved to
	pthread_win32_thread_detach_np(); call pthread_win32_thread_detach_np()
	directly if statically linking, otherwise do so via dllMain; store
	thread return value in thread struct for all cases, including
	cancellation and exception exits; thread abnormal exits	go via
	pthread_win32_thread_detach_np.
	* pthread_join.c (pthread_join): Don't try to get return code from
	Win32 thread - always get it from he thread struct.
	* pthread_detach.c (pthread_detach): reduce extent of the thread
	existence check since we now don't care if the Win32 thread HANDLE has
	been closed; reclaim thread resources if the thread has exited already.
	* ptw32_throw.c (ptw32_throw): For Win32 threads that are not implicit,
	only Call thread cleanup if statically linking, otherwise leave it to
	dllMain.
	* sem_post.c (_POSIX_SEM_VALUE_MAX): Change to SEM_VALUE_MAX.
	* sem_post_multiple.c: Likewise.
	* sem_init.c: Likewise.

2005-05-10  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_join.c (pthread_join): Add missing check for thread ID
	reference count in thread existence test; reduce extent of the
	existence test since we don't care if the Win32 thread HANDLE has
	been closed.

2005-05-09  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* ptw32_callUserDestroyRoutines.c: Run destructor process (i.e.
	loop over all keys calling destructors) up to
	PTHREAD_DESTRUCTOR_ITERATIONS times if TSD value isn't NULL yet;
	modify assoc management.
	* pthread_key_delete.c: Modify assoc management.
	* ptw32_tkAssocDestroy.c: Fix error in assoc removal from chains.
	* pthread.h
	(_POSIX_THREAD_DESTRUCTOR_ITERATIONS): Define to value specified by
	POSIX.
	(_POSIX_THREAD_KEYS_MAX): Define to value specified by POSIX.
	(PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX): Redefine [upward] to minimum required by POSIX.
	(SEM_NSEMS_MAX): Define to implementation value.
	(SEM_VALUE_MAX): Define to implementation value.
	(_POSIX_SEM_NSEMS_MAX): Redefine to value specified by POSIX.
	(_POSIX_SEM_VALUE_MAX): Redefine to value specified by POSIX.

2005-05-06  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* signal.c (sigwait): Add a cancellation point to this otherwise
	no-op.
	* sem_init.c (sem_init): Check for and return ERANGE error.
	* sem_post.c (sem_post): Likewise.
	* sem_post_multiple.c (sem_post_multiple): Likewise.
	* manual (directory): Added; see ChangeLog inside.

2005-05-02  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* implement.h (struct pthread_key_t_): Change threadsLock to keyLock
	so as not to be confused with the per thread lock 'threadlock';
	change all references to it.
	* implement.h (struct ThreadKeyAssoc): Remove lock; add prevKey
	and prevThread pointers; re-implemented all routines that use this
	struct. The effect of this is to save one handle per association,
	which could potentially equal the number of keys multiplied by the
	number of threads, accumulating over time - and to free the
	association memory as soon as it is no longer referenced by either
	the key or the thread. Previously, the handle and memory were
	released only after BOTH key and thread no longer referenced the
	association. That is, often no association resources were released
	until the process itself exited. In addition, at least one race
	condition has been removed - where two threads could attempt to
	release the association resources simultaneously - one via
	ptw32_callUserDestroyRoutines and the other via
	pthread_key_delete.

2005-04-25  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* ptw32_relmillisecs.c: New module; converts future abstime to 
	milliseconds relative to 'now'.
	* pthread_mutex_timedlock.c: Use new ptw32_relmillisecs routine in
	place of internal code; remove the NEED_SEM code - this routine is now
	implemented for builds that define NEED_SEM (WinCE etc)
	* sem_timedwait.c: Likewise; after timeout or cancellation,
	re-attempt to acquire the semaphore in case one has been posted since
	the timeout/cancel occurred. Thanks to Stefan Mueller.
	* Makefile: Add ptw32_relmillisecs.c module; remove
	ptw32_{in,de}crease_semaphore.c modules.
	* GNUmakefile: Likewise.
	* Bmakefile: Likewise.

	* sem_init.c: Re-write the NEED_SEM code to be consistent with the
	non-NEED_SEM code, but retaining use of an event in place of the w32 sema
	for w32 systems that don't include semaphores (WinCE);
	the NEED_SEM versions of semaphores has been broken for a long time but is
	now fixed and supports all of the same routines as the non-NEED_SEM case.

	* pthread_once.c: Yet more changes, reverting closer to Gottlob Frege's
	first design, but retaining cancellation, priority boosting, and adding
	preservation of W32 error codes to make pthread_once transparent to
	GetLastError.

2005-04-11  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_once.c (pthread_once): Added priority boosting to

2005-03-16  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>^M

	* pthread_setcancelstate.c: Don't check for an async cancel event
	if the library is using alertable async cancel..

2005-03-14  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_once.c (pthread_once): Downgrade interlocked operations to simple
	memory operations where these are protected by the critical section; edit
	comments.

2005-03-13  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_once.c (pthread_once): Completely redesigned; a change was
	required to the ABI (pthread_once_t_), and resulting in a version
	compatibility index increment.

	NOTES:
	The design (based on pseudo code contributed by Gottlob Frege) avoids
	creating a kernel object if there is no contention. See URL for details:-
	http://sources.redhat.com/ml/pthreads-win32/2005/msg00029.html
	This uses late initialisation similar to the technique already used for
	pthreads-win32 mutexes and semaphores (from Alexander Terekhov).

	The subsequent cancelation cleanup additions (by rpj) could not be implemented
	without sacrificing some of the efficiency in Gottlob's design. In particular,
	although each once_control uses it's own event to block on, a global CS is
	required to manage it - since the event must be either re-usable or
	re-creatable under cancelation. This is not needed in the non-cancelable
	design because it is able to mark the event as closed (forever).

	When uncontested, a CS operation is equivalent to an Interlocked operation
	in speed. So, in the final design with cancelability, an uncontested
	once_control operation involves a minimum of five interlocked operations
	(including the LeaveCS operation).
	
	ALTERNATIVES:
	An alternative design from Alexander Terekhov proposed using a named mutex,
	as sketched below:-

	  if (!once_control) { // May be in TLS
	    named_mutex::guard guard(&once_control2);
	      if (!once_control2) {
	         <init>
	         once_control2 = true;
	      }
	    once_control = true;
	  }
	
	A more detailed description of this can be found here:-
	http://groups.yahoo.com/group/boost/message/15442

	[Although the definition of a suitable PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT precludes use of the
	TLS located flag, this is not critical.]
	
	There are three primary concerns though:-
	1) The [named] mutex is 'created' even in the uncontended case.
	2) A system wide unique name must be generated.
	3) Win32 mutexes are VERY slow even in the uncontended 	case. An uncontested
	Win32 mutex lock operation can be 50 (or more) times slower than an
	uncontested EnterCS operation.

	Ultimately, the named mutex trick is making use of the global locks maintained
	by the kernel.

	* pthread.h (pthread_once_t_): One flag and an event HANDLE added.
	(PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT): Additional values included.

2005-03-08  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_once.c (pthread_once): Redesigned to elliminate potential
	starvation problem.
	- reported by Gottlob Frege  <gottlobfrege at gmail.com>

	* ptw32_threadDestroy.c (ptw32_threadDestroy): Implicit threads were
	not closing their Win32 thread duplicate handle.
	- reported by Dmitrii Semii <bogolt at gmail.com>

2005-01-25  Ralf Kubis  <RKubis at mc.com>

	* Attempted acquisition of recursive mutex was causing waiting
	threads to not be woken when the mutex is released.

	* GNUmakefile (GCE): Generate correct version resource comments.

2005-01-01  Konstantin Voronkov  <beowinkle at yahoo.com>

	* pthread_mutex_lock.c (pthread_mutex_lock): The new atomic exchange
	mutex algorithm is known to allow a thread to steal the lock off
	FIFO waiting threads. The next waiting FIFO thread gets a spurious
	wake-up and must attempt to re-acquire the lock. The woken thread
	was setting itself as the mutex's owner before the re-acquisition.

2004-11-22  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_cond_wait.c (ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup): Undo change
	from 2004-11-02.
	* Makefile (DLL_VER): Added for DLL naming suffix - see README.
	* GNUmakefile (DLL_VER): Likewise.
	* Wmakefile (DLL_VER): Likewise.
	* Bmakefile (DLL_VER): Likewise.
	* pthread.dsw (version.rc): Added to MSVS workspace.

2004-11-20  Boudewijn Dekker  <b.dekker at ellipsis.nl>

	* pthread_getspecific.c (pthread_getspecific): Check for
	invalid (NULL) key argument.

2004-11-19  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* config.h (PTW32_THREAD_ID_REUSE_INCREMENT): Added to allow
	building the library for either unique thread IDs like Solaris
	or non-unique thread IDs like Linux; allows application developers
	to override the library's default insensitivity to some apps
	that may not be strictly POSIX compliant.
	* version.rc: New resource module to encode version information
	within the DLL.
	* pthread.h: Added PTW32_VERSION* defines and grouped sections
	required by resource compiler together; bulk of file is skipped
	if RC_INVOKED. Defined some error numbers and other names for
	Borland compiler.

2004-11-02  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_cond_wait.c (ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup): Lock CV mutex at
	start of cleanup handler rather than at the end.
	* implement.h (PTW32_THREAD_REUSE_EMPTY): Renamed from *_BOTTOM.
	(ptw32_threadReuseBottom): New global variable.
	* global.c (ptw32_threadReuseBottom): Declare new variable.
	* ptw32_reuse.c (ptw32_reuse): Change reuse LIFO stack to LILO queue
	to more evenly distribute use of reusable thread IDs; use renamed
	PTW32_THREAD_REUSE_EMPTY.
	* ptw32_processTerminate.c (ptw2_processTerminate): Use renamed
	PTW32_THREAD_REUSE_EMPTY.

2004-10-31  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* implement.h (PThreadState): Add new state value
	'PThreadStateCancelPending'.
	* pthread_testcancel.c (pthread_testcancel): Use new thread
	'PThreadStateCancelPending' state as short cut to avoid entering
	kernel space via WaitForSingleObject() call. This was obviated
	by user space sema acquisition in sem_wait() and sem_timedwait(),
	which are also cancelation points. A call to pthread_testcancel()
	was required, which introduced a kernel call, effectively nullifying
	any gains made by the user space sem acquisition checks.
	* pthread_cancel.c (pthread_cancel): Set new thread
	'PThreadStateCancelPending' state.

2004-10-29  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* implement.h (pthread_t): Renamed to ptw32_thread_t; struct contains
	all thread state.
	* pthread.h (ptw32_handle_t): New general purpose struct to serve
	as a handle for various reusable object IDs - currently only used
	by pthread_t; contains a pointer to ptw32_thread_t (thread state)
	and a general purpose uint for use as a reuse counter or flags etc.
	(pthread_t): typedef'ed to ptw32_handle_t; the uint is the reuse
	counter that allows the library to maintain unique POSIX thread IDs.
	When the pthread struct reuse stack was introduced, threads would
	often acquire an identical ID to a previously destroyed thread. The
	same was true for the pre-reuse stack library, by virtue of pthread_t
	being the address of the thread struct. The new pthread_t retains
	the reuse stack but provides virtually unique thread IDs.
	* sem_wait.c (ptw32_sem_wait_cleanup): New routine used for
	cancelation cleanup.
	* sem_timedwait.c (ptw32_sem_timedwait_cleanup): Likewise.

2004-10-22  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* sem_init.c (sem_init): Introduce a 'lock' element in order to
	replace the interlocked operations with conventional serialisation.
	This is needed in order to be able to atomically modify the sema
	value and perform Win32 sema release operations. Win32 semaphores are
	used instead of events in order to support efficient multiple posting.
	If the whole modify/release isn't atomic, a race between
	sem_timedwait() and sem_post() could result in a release when there is
	no waiting semaphore, which would cause too many threads to proceed.
	* sem_wait.c (sem_wait): Use new 'lock'element.
	* sem_timedwait.c (sem_timedwait): Likewise.
	* sem_trywait.c (sem_trywait): Likewise.
	* sem_post.c (sem_post): Likewise.
	* sem_post_multiple.c (sem_post_multiple): Likewise.
	* sem_getvalue.c (sem_getvalue): Likewise.
	* ptw32_semwait.c (ptw32_semwait): Likewise.
	* sem_destroy.c (sem_destroy): Likewise; also tightened the conditions
	for semaphore destruction; in particular, a semaphore will not be
	destroyed if it has waiters.
	* sem_timedwait.c (sem_timedwait): Added cancel cleanup handler to
	restore sema value when cancelled.
	* sem_wait.c (sem_wait): Likewise.

2004-10-21  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_mutex_unlock.c (pthread_mutex_unlock): Must use PulseEvent()
	rather than SetEvent() to reset the event if there are no waiters.

2004-10-19  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* sem_init.c (sem_init): New semaphore model based on the same idea
	as mutexes, i.e. user space interlocked check to avoid 
	unnecessarily entering kernel space. Wraps the Win32 semaphore and
	keeps it's own counter. Although the motivation to do this has existed
	for a long time, credit goes to Alexander Terekhov for providing
	the logic. I have deviated slightly from AT's logic to add the waiters
	count, which has made the code more complicated by adding cancelation
	cleanup. This also appears to have broken the VCE (C++ EH) version of
	the library (the same problem as previously reported - see BUGS #2),
	only apparently not fixable using the usual workaround, nor by turning
	all optimisation off. The GCE version works fine, so it is presumed to
	be a bug in MSVC++ 6.0. The cancelation exception is thrown and caught
	correctly, but the cleanup class destructor is never called. The failing
	test is tests\semaphore4.c.
	* sem_wait.c (sem_wait): Implemented user space check model.
	* sem_post.c (sem_post): Likewise.
	* sem_trywait.c (sem_trywait): Likewise.
	* sem_timedwait.c (sem_timedwait): Likewise.
	* sem_post_multiple.c (sem_post_multiple): Likewise.
	* sem_getvalue.c (sem_getvalue): Likewise.
	* ptw32_semwait.c (ptw32_semwait): Likewise.
	* implement.h (sem_t_): Add counter element.

2004-10-15  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* implement.h (pthread_mutex_t_): Use an event in place of
	the POSIX semaphore.
	* pthread_mutex_init.c: Create the event; remove semaphore init.
	* pthread_mutex_destroy.c: Delete the event.
	* pthread_mutex_lock.c: Replace the semaphore wait with the event wait.
	* pthread_mutex_trylock.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_mutex_timedlock.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_mutex_unlock.c: Set the event.
	
2004-10-14  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_mutex_lock.c (pthread_mutex_lock): New algorithm using
	Terekhov's xchg based variation of Drepper's cmpxchg model.
	Theoretically, xchg uses fewer clock cycles than cmpxchg (using IA-32
	as a reference), however, in my opinion bus locking dominates the
	equation on smp systems, so the model with the least number of bus
	lock operations in the execution path should win, which is Terekhov's
	variant. On IA-32 uni-processor systems, it's faster to use the
	CMPXCHG instruction without locking the bus than to use the XCHG
	instruction, which always locks the bus. This makes the two variants
	equal for the non-contended lock (fast lane) execution path on up
	IA-32. Testing shows that the xchg variant is faster on up IA-32 as
	well if the test forces higher lock contention frequency, even though
	kernel calls should be dominating the times (on up IA-32, both
	variants used CMPXCHG instructions and neither locked the bus).
	* pthread_mutex_timedlock.c pthread_mutex_timedlock(): Similarly.
	* pthread_mutex_trylock.c (pthread_mutex_trylock): Similarly.
	* pthread_mutex_unlock.c (pthread_mutex_unlock): Similarly.
	* ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange.c (ptw32_InterlockExchange): New
	function.
	(PTW32_INTERLOCKED_EXCHANGE): Sets up macro to use inlined
	ptw32_InterlockedExchange.
	* implement.h (PTW32_INTERLOCKED_EXCHANGE): Set default to
	InterlockedExchange().
	* Makefile: Building using /Ob2 so that asm sections within inline
	functions are inlined.

2004-10-08  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_mutex_destroy.c (pthread_mutex_destroy): Critical Section
	element is no longer required.
	* pthread_mutex_init.c (pthread_mutex_init): Likewise.
	* pthread_mutex_lock.c (pthread_mutex_lock): New algorithm following
	Drepper's paper at http://people.redhat.com/drepper/futex.pdf, but
	using the existing semaphore in place of the futex described in the
	paper. Idea suggested by Alexander Terekhov - see:
	http://sources.redhat.com/ml/pthreads-win32/2003/msg00108.html
	* pthread_mutex_timedlock.c pthread_mutex_timedlock(): Similarly.
	* pthread_mutex_trylock.c (pthread_mutex_trylock): Similarly.
	* pthread_mutex_unlock.c (pthread_mutex_unlock): Similarly.
	* pthread_barrier_wait.c (pthread_barrier_wait): Use inlined version
	of InterlockedCompareExchange() if possible - determined at
	build-time.
	* pthread_spin_destroy.c pthread_spin_destroy(): Likewise.
	* pthread_spin_lock.c pthread_spin_lock():Likewise.
	* pthread_spin_trylock.c (pthread_spin_trylock):Likewise.
	* pthread_spin_unlock.c (pthread_spin_unlock):Likewise.
	* ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange.c: Sets up macro for inlined use.
	* implement.h (pthread_mutex_t_): Remove Critical Section element.
	(PTW32_INTERLOCKED_COMPARE_EXCHANGE): Set to default non-inlined
	version of InterlockedCompareExchange().
	* private.c: Include ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange.c first for
	inlining.
	* GNUmakefile: Add commandline option to use inlined
	InterlockedCompareExchange().
	* Makefile: Likewise.

2004-09-27  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_mutex_lock.c (pthread_mutex_lock): Separate
	PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL logic since we do not need to keep or check some
	state required by other mutex types; do not check mutex pointer arg
	for validity - leave this to the system since we are only checking
	for NULL pointers. This should improve speed of NORMAL mutexes and
	marginally improve speed of other type.
	* pthread_mutex_trylock.c (pthread_mutex_trylock): Likewise.
	* pthread_mutex_unlock.c (pthread_mutex_unlock): Likewise; also avoid
	entering the critical section for the no-waiters case, with approx.
	30% reduction in lock/unlock overhead for this case.
	* pthread_mutex_timedlock.c (pthread_mutex_timedlock): Likewise; also
	no longer keeps mutex if post-timeout second attempt succeeds - this
	will assist applications that wish to impose strict lock deadlines,
	rather than simply to escape from frozen locks.

2004-09-09  Tristan Savatier  <tristan at mpegtv.com>
	* pthread.h (struct pthread_once_t_): Qualify the 'done' element
	as 'volatile'.
	* pthread_once.c: Concerned about possible race condition,
	specifically on MPU systems re concurrent access to multibyte types.
	[Maintainer's note: the race condition is harmless on SPU systems
	and only a problem on MPU systems if concurrent access results in an
	exception (presumably generated by a hardware interrupt). There are
	other instances of similar harmless race conditions that have not
	been identified as issues.]

2004-09-09  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h: Declare additional types as volatile.

2004-08-27  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_barrier_wait.c (pthread_barrier_wait): Remove excessive code
	by substituting the internal non-cancelable version of sem_wait
	(ptw32_semwait).

2004-08-25  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_join.c (pthread_join): Rewrite and re-order the conditional
	tests in an attempt to improve efficiency and remove a race
	condition.

2004-08-23  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* create.c (pthread_create): Don't create a thread if the thread
	id pointer location (first arg) is inaccessible. A memory
	protection fault will result if the thread id arg isn't an accessible
	location. This is consistent with GNU/Linux but different to
	Solaris or MKS (and possibly others), which accept NULL as meaning
	'don't return the created thread's ID'. Applications that run
	using pthreads-win32 will run on all other POSIX threads
	implementations, at least w.r.t. this feature.

	It was decided not to copy the Solaris et al behaviour because,
	although it would have simplified some application porting (but only
	from Solaris to Windows), the feature is not technically necessary,
	and the alternative segfault behaviour helps avoid buggy application
	code.

	QueueUserAPCEx features at run-time.
	(ptw32_RegisterCancelation): Drop in replacement for QueueUserAPCEx()
	if it can't be used. Provides older style non-preemptive async
	cancelation.
	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c (pthread_win32_attach_np):
	Auto-detect quserex.dll and the availability of alertdrv.sys;
	initialise and close on process attach/detach.
	* global.c (ptw32_register_cancelation): Pointer to either
	QueueUserAPCEx() or ptw32_RegisterCancelation() depending on
	availability. QueueUserAPCEx makes pre-emptive async cancelation
	possible.
	* implement.h: Add definitions and prototypes related to QueueUserAPC.

2004-05-16  Panagiotis E. Hadjidoukas <peh at hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr>

	* QueueUserAPCEx (separate contributed package): Provides preemptive
	APC feature.
	* pthread_cancel.c (pthread_cancel): Initial integration of
	QueueUserAPCEx into pthreads-win32 to provide true pre-emptive
	async cancelation of threads, including blocked threads.

2004-05-06  Makoto Kato  <raven at oldskool.jp>

	* pthread.h (DWORD_PTR): Define typedef for older MSVC.
	* pthread_cancel.c (AMD64): Add architecture specific Context register.
	* ptw32_getprocessors.c: Use correct types (DWORD_PTR) for mask
	variables.

2004-04-06  P. van Bruggen  <pietvb at newbridges.nl>

	* ptw32_threadDestroy.c: Destroy threadLock mutex to
	close a memory leak.

2004-02-13  Gustav Hallberg  <gustav at virtutech.com>

	* pthread_equal.c: Remove redundant equality logic.

2003-12-10  Philippe Di Cristo  <philipped at voicebox.com>

	* sem_timedwait.c (sem_timedwait): Fix timeout calculations.

2003-10-20  Alexander Terekhov  <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* pthread_mutex_timedlock.c (ptw32_semwait): Move to individual module.
	* ptw32_semwait.c: New module.
	* pthread_cond_wait.c (ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup): Replace cancelable
	sem_wait() call with non-cancelable ptw32_semwait() call.
	* pthread.c (private.c): Re-order for inlining. GNU C warned that
	function ptw32_semwait() was defined 'inline' after it was called.
	* pthread_cond_signal.c (ptw32_cond_unblock): Likewise.
	* pthread_delay_np.c: Disable Watcom warning with comment.
	* *.c (process.h): Remove include from .c files. This is conditionally
	included by the common project include files.

2003-10-20  James Ewing  <james.ewing at sveasoft.com>

	* ptw32_getprocessors.c: Some Win32 environments don't have
	GetProcessAffinityMask(), so always return CPU count = 1 for them.
	* config.h (NEED_PROCESSOR_AFFINITY_MASK): Define for WinCE.
	
2003-10-15  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* Re-indented all .c files using default GNU style to remove assorted
	editor ugliness (used GNU indent utility in default style).

2003-10-15  Alex Blanco  <Alex.Blanco at motorola.com>

	* sem_init.c (sem_init): Would call CreateSemaphore even if the sema
	struct calloc failed; was not freeing calloced memory if either
	CreateSemaphore or CreateEvent failed.

2003-10-14  Ross Johnson  <ross at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h: Add Watcom compiler compatibility. Esssentially just add
	the cdecl attribute to all exposed function prototypes so that Watcom
	generates function call code compatible with non-Watcom built libraries.
	By default, Watcom uses registers to pass function args if possible rather
	than pushing to stack.
	* semaphore.h: Likewise.
	* sched.h: Likewise.
	* pthread_cond_wait.c (ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup): Define with cdecl attribute
	for Watcom compatibility. This routine is called via pthread_cleanup_push so
	it had to match function arg definition.
	* Wmakefile: New makefile for Watcom builds.

2003-09-14  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_setschedparam.c (pthread_setschedparam): Attempt to map
	all priority levels between max and min (as returned by
	sched_get_priority_min/max) to reasonable Win32 priority levels - i.e.
	levels between THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST/IDLE to THREAD_PRIORITY_LOWEST and
	between THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST/TIME_CRITICAL to THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST
	while others remain unchanged; record specified thread priority level
	for return by pthread_getschedparam.

	Note that, previously, specified levels not matching Win32 priority levels
	would silently leave the current thread priority unaltered.

	* pthread_getschedparam.c (pthread_getschedparam): Return the priority
	level specified by the latest pthread_setschedparam or pthread_create rather
	than the actual running thread priority as returned by GetThreadPriority - as
	required by POSIX. I.e. temporary or adjusted actual priority levels are not
	returned by this routine.

	* pthread_create.c (pthread_create): For priority levels specified via
	pthread attributes, attempt to map all priority levels between max and
	min (as returned by sched_get_priority_min/max) to reasonable Win32
	priority levels; record priority level given via attributes, or
	inherited from parent thread, for later return by pthread_getschedparam.

	* ptw32_new.c (ptw32_new): Initialise pthread_t_ sched_priority element.

	* pthread_self.c (pthread_self): Set newly created implicit POSIX thread
	sched_priority to Win32 thread's current actual priority. Temporarily
	altered priorities can't be avoided in this case.

	* implement.h (struct pthread_t_): Add new sched_priority element.

2003-09-12  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* sched_get_priority_min.c (sched_get_priority_min): On error should return -1
	with errno set.
	* sched_get_priority_max.c (sched_get_priority_max): Likewise.

2003-09-03  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* w32_cancelableWait.c (ptw32_cancelable_wait): Allow cancelation
	of implicit POSIX threads as well.

2003-09-02  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c (pthread_win32_thread_detach_np):
	Add comment.

	* pthread_exit.c (pthread_exit): Fix to recycle the POSIX thread handle in
	addition to calling user TSD destructors. Move the implicit POSIX thread exit
	handling to ptw32_throw to centralise the logic.

	* ptw32_throw.c (ptw32_throw): Implicit POSIX threads have no point
	to jump or throw to, so cleanup and exit the thread here in this case. For
	processes using the C runtime, the exit code will be set to the POSIX
	reason for the throw (i.e. PTHREAD_CANCEL or the value given to pthread_exit).
	Note that pthread_exit() already had similar logic, which has been moved to
	here.

	* ptw32_threadDestroy.c (ptw32_threadDestroy): Don't close the Win32 handle
	of implicit POSIX threads - expect this to be done by Win32?

2003-09-01  Ross Johnson  <rpj at callisto.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_self.c (pthread_self): The newly aquired pthread_t must be
	assigned to the reuse stack, not freed, if the routine fails somehow.

2003-08-13  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_getschedparam.c (pthread_getschedparam): An invalid thread ID
	parameter was returning an incorrect error value; now uses a more exhaustive
	check for validity.

	* pthread_setschedparam.c (pthread_setschedparam): Likewise.

	* pthread_join.c (pthread_join): Now uses a more exhaustive
	check for validity.

	* pthread_detach.c (pthread_detach): Likewise.

	* pthread_cancel.c (pthread_cancel): Likewise.

	* ptw32_threadDestroy.c (ptw32_threadDestroy): pthread_t structs are
	never freed - push them onto a stack for reuse.

	* ptw32_new.c (ptw32_new): Check for reusable pthread_t before dynamically
	allocating new memory for the struct.

	* pthread_kill.c (pthread_kill): New file; new routine; takes only a zero
	signal arg so that applications can check the thread arg for validity; checks
	that the underlying Win32 thread HANDLE is valid.

	* pthread.h (pthread_kill): Add prototype.

	* ptw32_reuse.c (ptw32_threadReusePop): New file; new routine; pop a
	pthread_t off the reuse stack. pthread_t_ structs that have been destroyed, i.e.
	have exited detached or have been joined, are cleaned up and put onto a reuse
	stack. Consequently, thread IDs are no longer freed once calloced. The library
	will attempt to get a struct off this stack before asking the system to alloc
	new memory when creating threads. The stack is guarded by a global mutex.
	(ptw32_threadReusePush): New routine; push a pthread_t onto the reuse stack.

	* implement.h (ptw32_threadReusePush): Add new prototype.
	(ptw32_threadReusePop): Likewise.
	(pthread_t): Add new element.

	* ptw32_processTerminate.c (ptw32_processTerminate): Delete the thread
	reuse lock; free all thread ID structs on the thread reuse stack.

	* ptw32_processInitialize.c (ptw32_processInitialize): Initialise the
	thread reuse lock.

2003-07-19  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* GNUmakefile: modified to work under MsysDTK environment.
	* pthread_spin_lock.c (pthread_spin_lock): Check for NULL arg.
	* pthread_spin_unlock.c (pthread_spin_unlock): Likewise.
	* pthread_spin_trylock.c (pthread_spin_trylock): Likewise;
	fix incorrect pointer value if lock is dynamically initialised by
	this function.
	* sem_init.c (sem_init): Initialise sem_t value to quell compiler warning.
	* sem_destroy.c (sem_destroy): Likewise.
	* ptw32_threadStart.c (non-MSVC code sections): Include <exception> rather
	than old-style <new.h>; fix all std:: namespace entities such as
	std::terminate_handler instances and associated methods.
	* ptw32_callUserDestroyRoutines.c (non-MSVC code sections): Likewise.

2003-06-24  Piet van Bruggen  <pietvb at newbridges.nl>

	* pthread_spin_destroy.c (pthread_spin_destroy): Was not freeing the
	spinlock struct.

2003-06-22  Nicolas Barry  <boozai at yahoo.com>

	* pthread_mutex_destroy.c (pthread_mutex_destroy): When called
	with a recursive mutex that was locked by the current thread, the
	function was failing with a success return code.

2003-05-15  Steven Reddie  <Steven.Reddie at ca.com>

	* pthread_win32_attach_detach_np.c (pthread_win32_process_detach_np):
	NULLify ptw32_selfThreadKey after the thread is destroyed, otherwise
	destructors calling pthreads routines might resurrect it again, creating
	memory leaks. Call the underlying Win32 Tls routine directly rather than
	pthread_setspecific().
	(pthread_win32_thread_detach_np): Likewise.

2003-05-14  Viv  <vcotirlea at hotmail.com>

	* pthread.dsp: Change /MT compile flag to /MD.

2003-03-04  Alexander Terekhov  <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* pthread_mutex_timedlock.c (pthread_mutex_timedlock): Fix failure to
	set ownership of mutex on second grab after abstime timeout.
	- bug reported by Robert Strycek <strycek at posam.sk>

2002-12-17  Thomas Pfaff  <tpfaff at gmx.net>

	* pthread_mutex_lock.c (ptw32_semwait): New static routine to provide
	a non-cancelable sem_wait() function. This is consistent with the
	way that pthread_mutex_timedlock.c does it.
	(pthread_mutex_lock): Use ptw32_semwait() instead of sem_wait().

2002-12-11  Thomas Pfaff  <tpfaff at gmx.net>

	* pthread_mutex_trylock.c: Should return EBUSY rather than EDEADLK.
	* pthread_mutex_destroy.c: Remove redundant ownership test (the
	trylock call does this for us); do not destroy a recursively locked
	mutex.

2002-09-20  Michael Johnson  <michaelj at maine.rr.com>

	* pthread_cond_destroy.c (pthread_cond_destroy): 
	When two different threads exist, and one is attempting to
	destroy a condition variable while the other is attempting to
	initialize a condition variable that was created with
	PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER, a deadlock can occur. Shrink
	the ptw32_cond_list_lock critical section to fix it.

2002-07-31  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* ptw32_threadStart.c (ptw32_threadStart): Thread cancelLock
	destruction moved to ptw32_threadDestroy().

	* ptw32_threadDestroy.c (ptw32_threadDestroy):  Destroy
	the thread's cancelLock. Moved here from ptw32_threadStart.c
	to cleanup implicit threads as well.

2002-07-30  Alexander Terekhov  <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* pthread_cond_wait.c (ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup): 
	Remove code designed to avoid/prevent spurious wakeup
	problems. It is believed that the sem_timedwait() call
	is consuming a CV signal that it shouldn't and this is
	breaking the avoidance logic.

2002-07-30  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* sem_timedwait.c (sem_timedwait): Tighten checks for
	unreasonable abstime values - that would result in
	unexpected timeout values.

	* w32_CancelableWait.c (ptw32_cancelable_wait):
	Tighten up return value checking and add comments.


2002-06-08  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* sem_getvalue.c (sem_getvalue): Now returns a value for the
	NEED_SEM version (i.e. earlier versions of WinCE).


2002-06-04  Rob Fanner  <rfanner at stonethree.com>

	* sem_getvalue.c (sem_getvalue): The Johnson M. Hart
	approach didn't work - we are forced to take an
	intrusive approach. We try to decrement the sema
	and then immediately release it again to get the
	value. There is a small probability that this may
	block other threads, but only momentarily.

2002-06-03  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* sem_init.c (sem_init): Initialise Win32 semaphores
	to _POSIX_SEM_VALUE_MAX (which this implementation
	defines in pthread.h) so that sem_getvalue() can use
	the trick described in the comments in sem_getvalue().
	* pthread.h (_POSIX_SEM_VALUE_MAX): Defined.
	(_POSIX_SEM_NSEMS_MAX): Defined - not used but may be
	useful for source code portability.

2002-06-03  Rob Fanner  <rfanner at stonethree.com>

	* sem_getvalue.c (sem_getvalue): Did not work on NT.
	Use approach suggested by Johnson M. Hart in his book
	"Win32 System Programming".

2002-02-28  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* errno.c: Compiler directive was incorrectly including code.
	* pthread.h: Conditionally added some #defines from config.h
	needed when not building the library. e.g. NEED_ERRNO, NEED_SEM.
	(PTW32_DLLPORT): Now only defined if _DLL defined.
	(_errno): Compiler directive was incorrectly including prototype.
	* sched.h: Conditionally added some #defines from config.h
	needed when not building the library.
	* semaphore.h: Replace an instance of NEED_SEM that should
	have been NEED_ERRNO. This change currently has nil effect.

	* GNUmakefile: Correct some recent changes.

	* Makefile: Add rule to generate pre-processor output.

2002-02-23  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_rwlock_timedrdlock.c: New - untested.
	* pthread_rwlock_timedwrlock.c: New - untested.
	
	* Testsuite passed (except known MSVC++ problems)

	* pthread_cond_destroy.c: Expand the time change
	critical section to solve deadlock problem.

	* pthread.c: Add all remaining C modules.
	* pthread.h: Use dllexport/dllimport attributes on functions
	to avoid using pthread.def.
	* sched.h: Likewise.
	* semaphore.h: Likewise.
	* GNUmakefile: Add new targets for single translation
	unit build to maximise inlining potential; generate
	pthread.def automatically.
	* Makefile: Likewise, but no longer uses pthread.def.

2002-02-20  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread_cond_destroy.c (pthread_cond_destroy):
	Enter the time change critical section earlier.

2002-02-17  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au

	* Testsuite passed.

	* pthread_timechange_handler_np.c: New; following
	a suggestion from Alexander Terekhov that CVs should
	be broadcast so that they all re-evaluate their
	condition variables and reset a new timeout if
	required, whenever an application receives a
	WM_TIMECHANGE message. This message indicates that
	the system time has been changed. Therefore, CVs
	waiting for a timeout set as an abs_time will possibly
	not wake up at the expected time. Some applications
	may not be tolerant of this.
	* pthread_cond_init.c: Add CV to linked list.
	* pthread_cond_destroy.c: Remove CV from linked list.
	* global.c (ptw32_cond_list_head): New variable.
	(ptw32_cond_list_tail): New variable.
	(ptw32_cond_list_cs): New critical section.
	* ptw32_processInitialize (ptw32_cond_list_cs): Initialize.
	* ptw32_processTerminate (ptw32_cond_list_cs): Delete.


	* Reduce executable size.

	cancelation point. Deferred cancels will interrupt the
	wait.

2002-02-07  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au

	* misc.c (ptw32_new): Add creation of cancelEvent so that
	implicit POSIX threads (Win32 threads with a POSIX face)
	are cancelable; mainly so that pthread_delay_np doesn't fail
	if called from the main thread.
	* create.c (pthread_create): Remove creation of cancelEvent
	from here; now in ptw32_new().

	Reduce executable size.
	-----------------------
	When linking with the static library, only those
	routines actually called, either directly or indirectly
	should be included.

	[Gcc has the -ffunction-segments option to do this but MSVC
	doesn't have this feature as far as I can determine. Other
	compilers are undetermined as well. - rpj]

	* barrier.c: All routines are now in separate compilation units;
	This file is used to congregate the separate modules for
	potential inline optimisation and backward build compatibility.
	* cancel.c: Likewise.

2002-02-04  Max Woodbury <mtew at cds.duke.edu>

	Reduced name space pollution.
	-----------------------------
	When the appropriate symbols are defined, the headers
	will restrict the definitions of new names. In particular,
	it must be possible to NOT include the <windows.h>
	header and related definitions with some combination
	of symbol definitions. Secondly, it should be possible
	that additional definitions should be limited to POSIX 
	compliant symbols by the definition of appropriate symbols.

	* pthread.h: POSIX conditionals.
	* sched.h: POSIX conditionals.
	* semaphore.h: POSIX conditionals.

	* semaphore.c: Included <limits.h>.
	(sem_init): Changed magic 0x7FFFFFFFL to INT_MAX.
	(sem_getvalue): Trial version.

	Reduce executable size.

	The following extends the idea above to the rest of pthreads-win32 - rpj
	
	* attr.c: All routines are now in separate compilation units;
	This file is used to congregate the separate modules for
	potential inline optimisation and backward build compatibility.
	* pthread_attr_destroy.c: Separated routine from attr.c.
	* pthread_attr_getdetachstate.c: Likewise.

	* pthread_attr_setscope.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_attr_setstackaddr.c: Likewise.
	* pthread_attr_setstacksize.c: Likewise.

	* pthread.c: Agregation of agregate modules for super-inlineability.

2002-02-02  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* cancel.c: Rearranged some code and introduced checks
	to disable cancelation at the start of a thread's cancelation
	run to prevent double cancelation. The main problem
	arises if a thread is canceling and then receives a subsequent
	async cancel request.
	* private.c: Likewise.
	* condvar.c: Place pragmas around cleanup_push/pop to turn
	off inline optimisation (/Obn where n>0 - MSVC only). Various
	optimisation switches in MSVC turn this on, which interferes with
	the way that cleanup handlers are run in C++ EH and SEH
	code. Application code compiled with inline optimisation must
	also wrap cleanup_push/pop blocks with the pragmas, e.g.
	  #pragma inline_depth(0)
	  pthread_cleanup_push(...)
	    ...
	  pthread_cleanup_pop(...)
	  #pragma inline_depth(8)
	* rwlock.c: Likewise.
	* mutex.c: Remove attempts to inline some functions.
	* signal.c: Modify misleading comment.

2002-02-01  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* semaphore.c (sem_trywait): Fix missing errno return
	for systems that define NEED_SEM (e.g. early WinCE).
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_timedlock): Return ENOTSUP
	for systems that define NEED_SEM since they don't
	have sem_trywait().

2002-01-27  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_timedlock): New function suggested by
	Alexander Terekhov. The logic required to implement this
	properly came from Alexander, with some collaboration
	with Thomas Pfaff.
	(pthread_mutex_unlock): Wrap the waiters check and sema
	post in a critical section to prevent a race with
	pthread_mutex_timedlock.
	(ptw32_timed_semwait): New function;
	returns a special result if the absolute timeout parameter
	represents a time already passed when called; used by
	pthread_mutex_timedwait(). Have deliberately not reused
	the name "ptw32_sem_timedwait" because they are not the same
	routine.
	* condvar.c (ptw32_cond_timedwait): Use the new sem_timedwait()
	instead of ptw32_sem_timedwait(), which now has a different
	function. See previous.
	* implement.h: Remove prototype for ptw32_sem_timedwait.
	See next.
	(pthread_mutex_t_): Add critical section element for access
	to lock_idx during mutex post-timeout processing.
	* semaphore.h (sem_timedwait): See next.
	* semaphore.c (sem_timedwait): See next.
	* private.c (ptw32_sem_timedwait): Move to semaphore.c
	and rename as sem_timedwait().

2002-01-18  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* sync.c (pthread_join): Was getting the exit code from the
	calling thread rather than the joined thread if
	defined(__MINGW32__) && !defined(__MSVCRT__).

2002-01-15  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h: Unless the build explicitly defines __CLEANUP_SEH,
	__CLEANUP_CXX, or __CLEANUP_C, then the build defaults to
	__CLEANUP_C style cleanup. This style uses setjmp/longjmp
	in the cancelation and thread exit implementations and therefore
	won't do stack unwinding if linked to applications that have it
	(e.g. C++ apps). This is currently consistent with most/all
	commercial Unix POSIX threads implementations.

	* spin.c (pthread_spin_init): Edit renamed function call.
	* nonportable.c (pthread_num_processors_np): New.
	(pthread_getprocessors_np): Renamed to ptw32_getprocessors
	and moved to private.c.
	* private.c (pthread_getprocessors): Moved here from
	nonportable.c.
	* pthread.def (pthread_getprocessors_np): Removed
	from export list.

	* rwlock.c (pthread_rwlockattr_init): New.
	(pthread_rwlockattr_destroy): New.
	(pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared): New.
	(pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared): New.

2002-01-14  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* attr.c (pthread_attr_setscope): Fix struct pointer
	indirection error introduced 2002-01-04.
	(pthread_attr_getscope): Likewise.

2002-01-12  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.dsp (SOURCE): Add missing source files.

2002-01-08  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_trylock): use
	ptw32_interlocked_compare_exchange function pointer
	rather than ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange() directly
	to retain portability to non-iX86 processors,
	e.g. WinCE etc. The pointer will point to the native
	OS version of InterlockedCompareExchange() if the
	OS supports it (see ChangeLog entry of 2001-10-17).

2002-01-07  Thomas Pfaff <tpfaff at gmx.net>, Alexander Terekhov <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_init): Remove critical
	section calls.
	(pthread_mutex_destroy): Likewise.
	(pthread_mutex_unlock): Likewise.
	(pthread_mutex_trylock): Likewise; uses
	ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange() to avoid need for
	critical section; library is no longer i386 compatible;
	recursive mutexes now increment the lock count rather
	than return EBUSY; errorcheck mutexes return EDEADLCK
	rather than EBUSY. This behaviour is consistent with the
	Solaris pthreads implementation.
	* implement.h (pthread_mutex_t_): Remove critical
	section element - no longer needed.
	

2002-01-04  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* attr.c (pthread_attr_setscope): Add more error
	checking and actually store the scope value even
	though it's not really necessary.
	(pthread_attr_getscope): Return stored value.
	* implement.h (pthread_attr_t_): Add new scope element.
	* ANNOUNCE: Fix out of date comment next to
	pthread_attr_setscope in conformance section.

2001-12-21  Alexander Terekhov <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_lock): Decrementing lock_idx was
	not thread-safe.
	(pthread_mutex_trylock): Likewise.

2001-10-26  prionx@juno.com

	* semaphore.c (sem_init): Fix typo and missing bracket
	in conditionally compiled code. Only older versions of
	WinCE require this code, hence it doesn't normally get
	tested; somehow when sem_t reverted to an opaque struct
	the calloc NULL check was left in the conditionally included
	section.
	(sem_destroy): Likewise, the calloced sem_t wasn't being freed.

2001-10-25  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* GNUmakefile (libwsock32): Add to linker flags for
	WSAGetLastError() and WSASetLastError().
	* Makefile (wsock32.lib): Likewise.
	* create.c: Minor mostly inert changes.
	* implement.h (PTW32_MAX): Move into here and renamed
	from sched.h.
	(PTW32_MIN): Likewise.
	* GNUmakefile (TEST_ICE): Define if testing internal
	implementation of InterlockedCompareExchange.
	* Makefile (TEST_ICE): Likewise.
	* private.c (TEST_ICE): Likewise.
	
2001-10-24  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* attr.c (pthread_attr_setstacksize): Quell warning
	from LCC by conditionally compiling the stacksize
	validity check. LCC correctly warns that the condition
	(stacksize < PTHREAD_STACK_MIN) is suspicious
	because STACK_MIN is 0 and stacksize is of type
	size_t (or unsigned int).

2001-10-17  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* barrier.c: Move _LONG and _LPLONG defines into
	implement.h; rename to PTW32_INTERLOCKED_LONG and
	PTW32_INTERLOCKED_LPLONG respectively.
	* spin.c: Likewise; ptw32_interlocked_compare_exchange used
	in place of InterlockedCompareExchange directly.
	* global.c (ptw32_interlocked_compare_exchange): Add
	prototype for this new routine pointer to be used when
	InterlockedCompareExchange isn't supported by Windows.
	* nonportable.c (pthread_win32_process_attach_np): Check for
	support of InterlockedCompareExchange in kernel32 and assign its
	address to ptw32_interlocked_compare_exchange if it exists, or
	our own ix86 specific implementation ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange.
	*private.c (ptw32_InterlockedCompareExchange): An
	implementation of InterlockedCompareExchange() which is
	specific to ix86; written directly in assembler for either
	MSVC or GNU C; needed because Windows 95 doesn't support
	InterlockedCompareExchange().

	* sched.c (sched_get_priority_min): Extend to return
	THREAD_PRIORITY_IDLE.
	(sched_get_priority_max): Extend to return
	THREAD_PRIORITY_CRITICAL.

2001-10-15  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* spin.c (pthread_spin_lock): PTHREAD_SPINLOCK_INITIALIZER
	was causing a program fault.
	(pthread_spin_init): Could have alloced memory
	without freeing under some error conditions.

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_init): Move memory
	allocation of mutex struct after checking for
	PROCESS_SHARED.

2001-10-12  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* spin.c (pthread_spin_unlock): Was not returning
	EPERM if the spinlock was not locked, for multi CPU
	machines.

2001-10-08  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* spin.c (pthread_spin_trylock): Was not returning
	EBUSY for multi CPU machines.

2001-08-24  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* condvar.c (pthread_cond_destroy): Remove cv element
	that is no longer used.
	* implement.h: Likewise.

2001-08-23  Alexander Terekhov <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* condvar.c (pthread_cond_destroy): fix bug with
	respect to deadlock in the case of concurrent
	_destroy/_unblock; a condition variable can be destroyed
	immediately after all the threads that are blocked on
	it are awakened.

2001-08-23  Phil Frisbie, Jr. <phil at hawksoft.com>

	* tsd.c (pthread_getspecific): Preserve the last
	winsock error [from WSAGetLastError()].

2001-07-18  Scott McCaskill <scott at magruder.org>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutexattr_init): Return ENOMEM
	immediately and don't dereference the NULL pointer
	if calloc fails.
	(pthread_mutexattr_getpshared): Don't dereference
	a pointer that is possibly NULL.
	* barrier.c (pthread_barrierattr_init): Likewise
	(pthread_barrierattr_getpshared): Don't dereference
	a pointer that is possibly NULL.
	* condvar.c (pthread_condattr_getpshared): Don't dereference
	a pointer that is possibly NULL.

2001-07-15  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* rwlock.c (pthread_rwlock_wrlock): Is allowed to be
	a cancelation point; re-enable deferred cancelability
	around the CV call.

2001-07-10  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* barrier.c: Still more revamping. The exclusive access
	mutex isn't really needed so it has been removed and replaced
	by an InterlockedDecrement(). nSerial has been removed.
	iStep is now dual-purpose. The process shared attribute
	is now stored in the barrier struct.
	* implement.h (pthread_barrier_t_): Lost some/gained one
	elements.
	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Removed some comments.

2001-07-10  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* barrier.c: Revamped to fix the race condition. Two alternating
	semaphores are used instead of the PulseEvent. Also improved
	overall throughput by returning PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD
	to the first waking thread.
	* implement.h (pthread_barrier_t_): Revamped.

2001-07-09  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* barrier.c: Fix several bugs in all routines. Now passes
	tests/barrier5.c which is fairly rigorous. There is still
	a non-optimal work-around for a race condition between
	the barrier breeched event signal and event wait. Basically
	the last (signalling) thread to hit the barrier yields
	to allow any other threads, which may have lost the race,
	to complete.

2001-07-07  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* barrier.c: Changed synchronisation mechanism to a
	Win32 manual reset Event and use PulseEvent to signal
	waiting threads. If the implementation continued to use
	a semaphore it would require a second semaphore and
	some management to use them alternately as barriers. A
	single semaphore allows threads to cascade from one barrier
	through the next, leaving some threads blocked at the first.
	* implement.h (pthread_barrier_t_): As per above.
	* general: Made a number of other routines inlinable.

2001-07-07  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* spin.c: Revamped and working; included static initialiser.
	Now beta level.
	* barrier.c: Likewise.
	* condvar.c: Macro constant change; inline auto init routine.
	* mutex.c: Likewise.
	* rwlock.c: Likewise.
	* private.c: Add support for spinlock initialiser.
	* global.c: Likewise.
	* implement.h: Likewise.
	* pthread.h (PTHREAD_SPINLOCK_INITIALIZER): Fix typo.

2001-07-05  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* barrier.c: Remove static initialisation - irrelevent
	for this object.
	* pthread.h (PTHREAD_BARRIER_INITIALIZER): Removed.
	* rwlock.c (pthread_rwlock_wrlock): This routine is
	not a cancelation point - disable deferred
	cancelation around call to pthread_cond_wait().

2001-07-05  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* spin.c: New module implementing spin locks.
	* barrier.c: New module implementing barriers.
	* pthread.h (_POSIX_SPIN_LOCKS): defined.
	(_POSIX_BARRIERS): Defined.
	(pthread_spin_*): Defined.
	(pthread_barrier*): Defined.
	(PTHREAD_BARRIER_SERIAL_THREAD): Defined.
	* implement.h (pthread_spinlock_t_): Defined.
	(pthread_barrier_t_): Defined.
	(pthread_barrierattr_t_): Defined.

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_lock): Return with the error
	if an auto-initialiser initialisation fails.

	* nonportable.c (pthread_getprocessors_np): New; gets the
	number of available processors for the current process.

2001-07-03  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h (_POSIX_READER_WRITER_LOCKS): Define it
	if not already defined.

2001-07-01  Alexander Terekhov <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* condvar.c: Fixed lost signal bug reported by Timur Aydin
	(taydin@snet.net).
	[RPJ (me) didn't translate the original algorithm
	correctly.]
	* semaphore.c: Added sem_post_multiple; this is a useful
	routine, but it doesn't appear to be standard. For now it's
	not an exported function.
	
2001-06-25  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* create.c (pthread_create): Add priority inheritance
	attributes.
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_lock): Remove some overhead for
	PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL mutex types. Specifically, avoid
	calling pthread_self() and pthread_equal() to check/set
	the mutex owner. Introduce a new pseudo owner for this
	type. Test results suggest increases in speed of up to
	90% for non-blocking locks.
	This is the default type of mutex used internally by other
	synchronising objects, ie. condition variables and
	read-write locks. The test rwlock7.c shows about a
	30-35% speed increase over snapshot 2001-06-06. The
	price of this is that the application developer
	must ensure correct behaviour, or explicitly set the
	mutex to a safer type such as PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK.
	For example, PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL (or PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT)
	type mutexes will not return an error if a thread which is not
	the owner calls pthread_mutex_unlock. The call will succeed
	in unlocking the mutex if it is currently locked, but a
	subsequent unlock by the true owner will then fail with EPERM.
	This is however consistent with some other implementations.
	(pthread_mutex_unlock): Likewise.
	(pthread_mutex_trylock): Likewise.
	(pthread_mutex_destroy): Likewise.
	* attr.c (pthread_attr_init): PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED is the
	default inheritance attribute; THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL is
	the default priority for new threads.
	* sched.c (pthread_attr_setschedpolicy): Added routine.
	(pthread_attr_getschedpolicy): Added routine.
	(pthread_attr_setinheritsched): Added routine.
	(pthread_attr_getinheritsched): Added routine.
	* pthread.h (sched_rr_set_interval): Added as a macro;
	returns -1 with errno set to ENOSYS.

2001-06-23  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	*sched.c (pthread_attr_setschedparam): Add priority range
	check.
	(sched_setscheduler): New function; checks for a valid
	pid and policy; checks for permission to set information
	in the target process; expects pid to be a Win32 process ID,
	not a process handle; the only scheduler policy allowed is
	SCHED_OTHER.
	(sched_getscheduler): Likewise, but checks for permission
	to query.
	* pthread.h (SCHED_*): Moved to sched.h as defined in the
	POSIX standard.
	* sched.h (SCHED_*): Moved from pthread.h.
	(pid_t): Defined if necessary.
	(sched_setscheduler): Defined.
	(sched_getscheduler): Defined.
	* pthread.def (sched_setscheduler): Exported.
	(sched_getscheduler): Likewise.

2001-06-23  Ralf Brese <Ralf.Brese at pdb4.siemens.de>

	* create.c (pthread_create): Set thread priority from
	thread attributes.

2001-06-18  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* Made organisational-only changes to UWIN additions.
	* dll.c (dllMain): Moved UWIN process attach code
	to pthread_win32_process_attach_np(); moved
	instance of pthread_count to global.c.
	* global.c (pthread_count): Moved from dll.c.
	* nonportable.c (pthread_win32_process_attach_np):
	Moved _UWIN code to here from dll.c.
	* implement.h (pthread_count): Define extern int.
	* create.c (pthread_count): Remove extern int.
	* private.c (pthread_count): Likewise.
	* exit.c (pthread_count): Likewise.

2001-06-18  David Korn <dgk at research.att.com>

	* dll.c: Added changes necessary to work with UWIN.
	* create.c: Likewise.
	* pthread.h: Likewise.
	* misc.c: Likewise.
	* exit.c: Likewise.
	* private.c: Likewise.
	* implement.h: Likewise.
	There is some room at the start of struct pthread_t_
	to implement the signal semantics in UWIN's posix.dll
	although this is not yet complete.
	* Nmakefile: Compatible with UWIN's Nmake utility.
	* Nmakefile.tests: Likewise - for running the tests.

2001-06-08  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* semaphore.h (sem_t): Fixed for compile and test.
	* implement.h (sem_t_): Likewise.
	* semaphore.c: Likewise.
	* private.c (ptw32_sem_timedwait): Updated to use new
	opaque sem_t.

2001-06-06  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* semaphore.h (sem_t): Is now an opaque pointer;
	moved actual definition to implement.h.
	* implement.h (sem_t_): Move here from semaphore.h;
	was the definition of sem_t.
	* semaphore.c: Wherever necessary, changed use of sem
	from that of a pointer to a pointer-pointer; added
	extra checks for a valid sem_t; NULL sem_t when
	it is destroyed; added extra checks when creating
	and destroying sem_t elements in the NEED_SEM
	code branches; changed from using a pthread_mutex_t
	((*sem)->mutex) to CRITICAL_SECTION ((*sem)->sem_lock_cs)
	in NEED_SEM branches for access serialisation.

2001-06-06  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutexattr_init): Remove 
	ptw32_mutex_default_kind.
	
2001-06-05  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* nonportable.c (pthread_mutex_setdefaultkind_np):
	Remove - should not have been included in the first place.
	(pthread_mutex_getdefaultkind_np): Likewise.
	* global.c (ptw32_mutex_default_kind): Likewise.
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_init): Remove use of
	ptw32_mutex_default_kind.
	* pthread.h (pthread_mutex_setdefaultkind_np): Likewise.
	(pthread_mutex_getdefaultkind_np): Likewise.
	* pthread.def (pthread_mutexattr_setkind_np): Added.
	(pthread_mutexattr_getkind_np): Likewise.

	* README: Many changes that should have gone in before
	the last snapshot.
	* README.NONPORTABLE: New - referred to by ANNOUNCE
	but never created; documents the non-portable routines
	included in the library - moved from README with new
	routines added.
	* ANNOUNCE (pthread_mutexattr_setkind_np): Added to
	compliance list.
	(pthread_mutexattr_getkind_np): Likewise.

2001-06-04  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* condvar.c: Add original description of the algorithm as
	developed by Terekhov and Thomas, plus reference to
	README.CV.

2001-06-03  Alexander Terekhov <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>, Louis Thomas <lthomas at arbitrade.com>

	* condvar.c (pthread_cond_init): Completely revamped.
	(pthread_cond_destroy): Likewise.
	(ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup): Likewise.
	(ptw32_cond_timedwait): Likewise.
	(ptw32_cond_unblock): New general signaling routine.
	(pthread_cond_signal): Now calls ptw32_cond_unblock.
	(pthread_cond_broadcast): Likewise.
	* implement.h (pthread_cond_t_): Revamped.
	* README.CV: New; explanation of the above changes.

2001-05-30  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h (rand_r): Fake using _seed argument to quell
	compiler warning (compiler should optimise this away later).

	* GNUmakefile (OPT): Leave symbolic information out of the library
	and increase optimisation level - for smaller faster prebuilt
	dlls.
	
2001-05-29  Milan Gardian <Milan.Gardian at LEIBINGER.com>

	* Makefile: fix typo.
	* pthreads.h: Fix problems with stdcall/cdecl conventions, in particular
	remove the need for PT_STDCALL everywhere; remove warning supression.
	* (errno): Fix the longstanding "inconsistent dll linkage" problem
	with errno; now also works with /MD debugging libs - 
	warnings emerged when compiling pthreads library with /MD (or /MDd)
	compiler switch, instead of /MT (or /MTd) (i.e. when compiling pthreads
	using Multithreaded DLL CRT instead of Multithreaded statically linked
	CRT).
	* create.c (pthread_create): Likewise; fix typo.
	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Eliminate use of terminate() which doesn't
	throw exceptions.
	* Remove unnecessary #includes from a number of modules -
	[I had to #include malloc.h in implement.h for gcc - rpj].

2001-05-29  Thomas Pfaff <tpfaff at gmx.net>

	* pthread.h (PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT): New; equivalent to
	PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT_NP.
	* (PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL): Similarly.
	* (PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK): Similarly.
	* (PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE): Similarly.
	* (pthread_mutex_setdefaultkind_np): New; Linux compatibility stub
	for pthread_mutexattr_settype.
	* (pthread_mutexattr_getkind_np): New; Linux compatibility stub
	for pthread_mutexattr_gettype.
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutexattr_settype): New; allow
	the following types of mutex:
	  PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT_NP
	  PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL_NP
	  PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK_NP
	  PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE_NP
	* Note that PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT is equivalent to
	PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL - ie. mutexes should no longer
	be recursive by default, and a thread will deadlock if it
	tries to relock a mutex it already owns. This is inline with
	other pthreads implementations.
	* (pthread_mutex_lock): Process the lock request
	according to the mutex type.
	* (pthread_mutex_init): Eliminate use of Win32 mutexes as the
	basis of POSIX mutexes - instead, a combination of one critical section
	and one semaphore are used in conjunction with Win32 Interlocked* routines.
	* (pthread_mutex_destroy): Likewise.
	* (pthread_mutex_lock): Likewise.
	* (pthread_mutex_trylock): Likewise.
	* (pthread_mutex_unlock): Likewise.
	* Use longjmp/setjmp to implement cancelation when building the library
	using a C compiler which doesn't support exceptions, e.g. gcc -x c (note
	that gcc -x c++ uses exceptions).
	* Also fixed some of the same typos and eliminated PT_STDCALL as
	Milan Gardian's patches above.

2001-02-07  Alexander Terekhov <TEREKHOV at de.ibm.com>

	* rwlock.c: Revamped.
	* implement.h (pthread_rwlock_t_): Redefined.
	This implementation does not have reader/writer starvation problem.
	Rwlock attempts to behave more like a normal mutex with
	races and scheduling policy determining who is more important;
	It also supports recursive locking,
	has less synchronization overhead (no broadcasts at all,
	readers are not blocked on any condition variable) and seem to
	be faster than the current implementation [W98 appears to be
	approximately 15 percent faster at least - on top of speed increase
	from Thomas Pfaff's changes to mutex.c - rpj].

2000-12-29  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* Makefile: Back-out "for" loops which don't work.

	* GNUmakefile: Remove the fake.a target; add the "realclean"
	target; don't remove built libs under the "clean" target.

	* config.h: Add a guard against multiple inclusion.

	* semaphore.h: Add some defines from config.h to make
	semaphore.h independent of config.h when building apps.

	* pthread.h (_errno): Back-out previous fix until we know how to
	fix it properly.

	* implement.h (lockCount): Add missing element to pthread_mutex_t_.

	* sync.c (pthread_join): Spelling fix in comment.

	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Reset original termination
	function (C++).
	(ptw32_threadStart): Cleanup detached threads early in case
	the library is statically linked.
	(ptw32_callUserDestroyRoutines): Remove [SEH] __try block from
	destructor call so that unhandled exceptions will be passed through
	to the 	system; call terminate() from [C++] try block for the same
	reason.

	* tsd.c (pthread_getspecific): Add comment.

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_init): Initialise new elements in
	pthread_mutex_t.
	(pthread_mutex_unlock): Invert "pthread_equal()" test.

2000-12-28  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* semaphore.c (mode_t): Use ifndef HAVE_MODE_T to include definition.

	* config.h.in (HAVE_MODE_T): Added.
	(_UWIN): Start adding defines for the UWIN package.

	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Unhandled exceptions are
	now passed through to the system to deal with. This is consistent
	with normal Windows behaviour. C++ applications may use
	set_terminate() to override the default behaviour which is
	to call ptw32_terminate(). Ptw32_terminate() cleans up some
	POSIX thread stuff before calling the system default function
	which calls abort(). The users termination function should conform
	to standard C++ semantics which is to not return. It should
	exit the thread (call pthread_exit()) or exit the application.
	* private.c (ptw32_terminate): Added as the default set_terminate()
	function. It calls the system default function after cleaning up
	some POSIX thread stuff.

	* implement.h (ptw32_try_enter_critical_section): Move
	declaration.
	* global.c (ptw32_try_enter_critical_section): Moved
	from dll.c.
	* dll.c: Move process and thread attach/detach code into
	functions in nonportable.c.
	* nonportable.c (pthread_win32_process_attach_np): Process
	attach code from dll.c is now available to static linked
	applications.
	* nonportable.c (pthread_win32_process_detach_np): Likewise.
	* nonportable.c (pthread_win32_thread_attach_np): Likewise.
	* nonportable.c (pthread_win32_thread_detach_np): Likewise.

	* pthread.h: Add new non-portable prototypes for static
	linked applications.

	* GNUmakefile (OPT): Increase optimisation flag and remove
	debug info flag.

	* pthread.def: Add new non-portable exports for static
	linked applications.

2000-12-11  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* FAQ: Update Answer 6 re getting a fully working
	Mingw32 built library.

2000-10-10  Steven Reddie <smr at essemer.com.au>
 
        * misc.c (pthread_self): Restore Win32 "last error"
        cleared by TlsGetValue() call in
        pthread_getspecific()
 
2000-09-20  Arthur Kantor <akantor at bexusa.com>
 
        * mutex.c (pthread_mutex_lock): Record the owner
        of the mutex. This requires also keeping count of
        recursive locks ourselves rather than leaving it
        to Win32 since we need to know when to NULL the
        thread owner when the mutex is unlocked.
        (pthread_mutex_trylock): Likewise.
        (pthread_mutex_unlock): Check that the calling
        thread owns the mutex, decrement the recursive
        lock count, and NULL the owner if zero. Return
        EPERM if the mutex is owned by another thread.
        * implement.h (pthread_mutex_t_): Add ownerThread
        and lockCount members.

2000-09-13  Jef Gearhart <jgearhart at tpssys.com>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_init): Call
	TryEnterCriticalSection through the pointer
	rather than directly so that the dll can load
	on Windows versions that can't resolve the
	function, eg. Windows 95

2000-09-09  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h (ctime_r): Fix arg.

2000-09-08  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* GNUmakefile(_WIN32_WINNT=0x400): Define in CFLAGS;
	doesn't seem to be needed though.

	* cancel.c (pthread_cancel): Must get "self" through
	calling pthread_self() which will ensure a POSIX thread
	struct is built for non-POSIX threads; return an error
	if this fails
	- Ollie Leahy <ollie at mpt.ie>
	(pthread_setcancelstate): Likewise.
	(pthread_setcanceltype): Likewise.
	* misc.c (ptw32_cancelable_wait): Likewise.

	* private.c (ptw32_tkAssocCreate): Remove unused #if 0
	wrapped code.

	* pthread.h (ptw32_get_exception_services_code):
	Needed to be forward declared unconditionally.

2000-09-06  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* cancel.c (pthread_cancel): If called from the main
	thread "self" would be NULL; get "self" via pthread_self()
	instead of directly from TLS so that an implicit
	pthread object is created.

	* misc.c (pthread_equal): Strengthen test for NULLs.

2000-09-02  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* condvar.c (ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup): Ensure that all
	waking threads check if they are the last, and notify
	the broadcaster if so - even if an error occurs in the
	waiter.

	* semaphore.c (_decrease_semaphore): Should be
	a call to ptw32_decrease_semaphore.
	(_increase_semaphore): Should be a call to
	ptw32_increase_semaphore.

	* misc.c (ptw32_cancelable_wait): Renamed from
	CancelableWait.
	* rwlock.c (_rwlock_check*): Renamed to
	ptw32_rwlock_check*.
	* mutex.c (_mutex_check*): Renamed to ptw32_mutex_check*.
	* condvar.c (cond_timed*): Renamed to ptw32_cond_timed*.
	(_cond_check*): Renamed to ptw32_cond_check*.
	(cond_wait_cleanup*): Rename to ptw32_cond_wait_cleanup*.
	(ptw32_cond_timedwait): Add comments.

2000-08-22  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* private.c (ptw32_throw): Fix exception test;
	move exceptionInformation declaration.

	* tsd.c (pthread_key_create): newkey wrongly declared.

	* pthread.h: Fix comment block.

2000-08-18  Ross Johnson  <rpj at setup1.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_destroy): Check that the mutex isn't
	held; invalidate the mutex as early as possible to avoid
	contention; not perfect - FIXME!

	* rwlock.c (pthread_rwlock_init): Remove redundant assignment
	to "rw".
	(pthread_rwlock_destroy): Invalidate the rwlock before
	freeing up any of it's resources - to avoid contention.

	* private.c (ptw32_tkAssocCreate): Change assoc->lock
	to use a dynamically initialised mutex - only consumes
	a W32 mutex or critical section when first used,
	not before.

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_init): Remove redundant assignment
	to "mx".
	(pthread_mutexattr_destroy): Set attribute to NULL
	before freeing it's memory - to avoid contention.

	* implement.h (PTW32_EPS_CANCEL/PTW32_EPS_EXIT):
	Must be defined for all compilers - used as generic
	exception selectors by ptw32_throw().

	* Several: Fix typos from scripted edit session
	yesterday.

	* nonportable.c (pthread_mutexattr_setforcecs_np):
	Moved this function from mutex.c.
	(pthread_getw32threadhandle_np): New function to
	return the win32 thread handle that the POSIX
	thread is using.
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutexattr_setforcecs_np):
	Moved to new file "nonportable.c".

	* pthread.h (PTW32_BUILD): Only	redefine __except
	and catch compiler keywords if we aren't building
	the library (ie. PTW32_BUILD is not defined) - 
	this is safer than defining and then undefining
	if not building the library.
	* implement.h: Remove __except and catch undefines.
	* Makefile (CFLAGS): Define PTW32_BUILD.
	* GNUmakefile (CFLAGS): Define PTW32_BUILD.

	* All appropriate: Change Pthread_exception* to
	ptw32_exception* to be consistent with internal
	identifier naming.

	* private.c (ptw32_throw): New function to provide
	a generic exception throw for all internal
	exceptions and EH schemes.
	(ptw32_threadStart): pthread_exit() value is now
	returned via the thread structure exitStatus
	element.
	* exit.c (pthread_exit): pthread_exit() value is now
	returned via the thread structure exitStatus
	element.
	* cancel.c (ptw32_cancel_self): Now uses ptw32_throw.
	(pthread_setcancelstate): Ditto.
	(pthread_setcanceltype): Ditto.
	(pthread_testcancel): Ditto.
	(pthread_cancel): Ditto.
	* misc.c (CancelableWait): Ditto.
	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Ditto.
	* All applicable: Change PTW32_ prefix to
	PTW32_ prefix to remove leading underscores
	from private library identifiers.

2000-08-17  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* All applicable: Change _pthread_ prefix to
	ptw32_ prefix to remove leading underscores
	from private library identifiers (single
	and double leading underscores are reserved in the
	ANSI C standard for compiler implementations).

	* tsd.c (pthread_create_key): Initialise temporary
	key before returning it's address to avoid race
	conditions.

2000-08-13  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* errno.c: Add _MD precompile condition; thus far
	had no effect when using /MD compile option but I
	thnk it should be there.

	* exit.c: Add __cplusplus to various #if lines;
	was compiling SEH code even when VC++ had
	C++ compile options.

	* private.c: ditto.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Add PT_STDCALL macro to
	function pointer arg in _beginthread().

	* pthread.h: PT_STDCALL really does need to be defined
	in both this and impliment.h; don't set it to __cdecl
	- this macro is only used to extend function pointer
	casting for functions that will be passed as parameters.
	(~PThreadCleanup): add cast and group expression.
	(_errno): Add _MD compile conditional.
	(PtW32NoCatchWarn): Change pragma message.

	* implement.h: Move and change PT_STDCALL define.

	* need_errno.h: Add _MD to compilation conditional.

	* GNUmakefile: Substantial rewrite for new naming
	convention; set for nil optimisation (turn it up
	when we have a working library build; add target
	"fake.a" to build a libpthreadw32.a from the VC++
	built DLL pthreadVCE.dll.

	* pthread.def (LIBRARY): Don't specify in the .def
	file - it is specified on the linker command line
	since we now use the same .def file for variously
	named .dlls.

	* Makefile: Substantial rewrite for new naming
	convention; default nmake target only issues a
	help message; run nmake with specific target
	corresponding to the EH scheme being used.

	* README: Update information; add naming convention
	explanation.

	* ANNOUNCE: Update information.

2000-08-12  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h: Add compile-time message when using
	MSC_VER compiler and C++ EH to warn application
	programmers to use PtW32Catch instead of catch(...)
	if they want cancelation and pthread_exit to work.

	* implement.h: Remove #include <semaphore.h>; we
	use our own local semaphore.h.

2000-08-10  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* cleanup.c (pthread_pop_cleanup): Remove _pthread
	prefix from __except and catch keywords; implement.h
	now simply undefines ptw32__except and
	ptw32_catch if defined; VC++ was not textually
	substituting ptw32_catch etc back to catch as
	it was redefined; the reason for using the prefixed
	version was to make it clear that it was not using
	the pthread.h redefined catch keyword.

	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Ditto.
	(ptw32_callUserDestroyRoutines): Ditto.

	* implement.h (ptw32__except): Remove #define.
	(ptw32_catch): Remove #define.

	* GNUmakefile (pthread.a): New target to build
	libpthread32.a from pthread.dll using dlltool.

	* buildlib.bat: Duplicate cl commands with args to
	build C++ EH version of pthread.dll; use of .bat
	files is redundant now that nmake compatible
	Makefile is included; used as a kludge only now.

	* Makefile: Localise some macros and fix up the clean:
	target to extend it and work properly.

	* CONTRIBUTORS: Add contributors.

	* ANNOUNCE: Updated.

	* README: Updated.

2000-08-06  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h: Remove #warning - VC++ doesn't accept it.

2000-08-05  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h (PtW32CatchAll): Add macro. When compiling
	applications using VC++ with C++ EH rather than SEH
	'PtW32CatchAll' must be used in place of any 'catch( ... )'
	if the application wants pthread cancelation or
	pthread_exit() to work.

2000-08-03  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h: Add a base class ptw32_exception for
	library internal exceptions and change the "catch"
	re-define macro to use it.

2000-08-02  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* GNUmakefile (CFLAGS): Add -mthreads.
	Add new targets to generate cpp and asm output.

	* sync.c (pthread_join): Remove dead code.

2000-07-25  Tristan Savatier <tristan at mpegtv.com>

	* sched.c (sched_get_priority_max): Handle different WinCE and
	Win32 priority values together.
	(sched_get_priority_min): Ditto.

2000-07-25  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* create.c (pthread_create): Force new threads to wait until
	pthread_create has the new thread's handle; we also retain
	a local copy of the handle for internal use until
	pthread_create returns.

	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Initialise ei[].
	(ptw32_threadStart): When beginthread is used to start the
	thread, force waiting until the creator thread had the 
	thread handle.

	* cancel.c (ptw32_cancel_thread): Include context switch
	code for defined(_X86_) environments in addition to _M_IX86.

	* rwlock.c (pthread_rwlock_destroy): Assignment changed
	to avoid compiler warning.

	* private.c (ptw32_get_exception_services_code): Cast
	NULL return value to avoid compiler warning.

	* cleanup.c (pthread_pop_cleanup): Initialise "cleanup" variable
	to avoid compiler warnings.

	* misc.c (ptw32_new): Change "new" variable to "t" to avoid
	confusion with the C++ keyword of the same name.

	* condvar.c (cond_wait_cleanup): Initialise lastWaiter variable.
	(cond_timedwait): Remove unused local variables. to avoid
	compiler warnings.

	* dll.c (dllMain): Remove 2000-07-21 change - problem
	appears to be in pthread_create().

2000-07-22  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* tsd.c (pthread_key_create): If a destructor was given
	and the pthread_mutex_init failed, then would try to
	reference a NULL pointer (*key); eliminate this section of
	code by using a dynamically initialised mutex
	(PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER).

	* tsd.c (pthread_setspecific): Return an error if
	unable to set the value; simplify cryptic conditional.

	* tsd.c (pthread_key_delete): Locking threadsLock relied
	on mutex_lock returning an error if the key has no destructor.
	ThreadsLock is only initialised if the key has a destructor.
	Making this mutex a static could reduce the number of mutexes
	used by an application since it is actually created only at
	first use and it's often destroyed soon after.
	
2000-07-22  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* FAQ: Added Q5 and Q6.

2000-07-21  David Baggett <dmb at itasoftware.com>

	* dll.c: Include resource leakage work-around. This is a
	partial FIXME which doesn't stop all leakage. The real
	problem needs to be found and fixed.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Set threadH to 0 (zero)
	everywhere. Some assignments were using NULL. Maybe
	it should be NULL everywhere - need to check. (I know
	they are nearly always the same thing - but not by
	definition.)

	* misc.c (pthread_self): Try to catch NULL thread handles
	at the point where they might be generated, even though
	they should always be valid at this point.

	* tsd.c (pthread_setspecific): return an error value if
	pthread_self() returns NULL.

	* sync.c (pthread_join): return an error value if
	pthread_self() returns NULL.

2000-01-28  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_init): Free mutex if it has been alloced;
	if critical sections can be used instead of Win32 mutexes, test
	that the critical section works and return an error if not.

2000-01-07  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* cleanup.c (pthread_pop_cleanup): Include SEH code only if MSC is not
	compiling as C++.
	(pthread_push_cleanup): Include SEH code only if MSC is not
	compiling as C++.

	* pthread.h: Include SEH code only if MSC is not
	compiling as C++.

	value of EXCEPTION_PTW32_SERVICES.
	(ptw32_processInitialize): Remove initialisation of
	ptw32_exception_services which is no longer needed.

	* pthread.h (ptw32_exception_services): Remove extern.
	(ptw32_get_exception_services_code): Add function prototype;
	use this to return EXCEPTION_PTW32_SERVICES value instead of
	using the ptw32_exception_services variable which I had
	trouble exporting through pthread.def.

	* global.c (ptw32_exception_services): Remove declaration.

1999-11-22  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* implement.h: Forward declare ptw32_new();

	* misc.c (ptw32_new): New; alloc and initialise a new pthread_t.
	(pthread_self): New thread struct is generated 	by new routine
	ptw32_new().

	* create.c (pthread_create): New thread struct is generated
	by new routine ptw32_new().

1999-11-21  Ross Johnson  <rpj at special.ise.canberra.edu.au>

	* global.c (ptw32_exception_services): Declare new variable. 

	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Destroy thread's
	cancelLock mutex; make 'catch' and '__except' usageimmune to
	redfinitions in pthread.h.
	(ptw32_processInitialize): Init new constant ptw32_exception_services.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Initialise thread's cancelLock
	mutex.

	* cleanup.c (pthread_pop_cleanup): Make 'catch' and '__except'
	usage immune to redfinition s in pthread.h.

	* private.c: Ditto.

	* pthread.h (catch): Redefine 'catch' so that C++ applications
	won't catch our internal exceptions.
	(__except): ditto for __except.

	* implement.h (ptw32_catch): Define internal version
	of 'catch' because 'catch' is redefined by pthread.h.
	(__except): ditto for __except.
	(struct pthread_t_): Add cancelLock mutex for async cancel
	safety.

1999-11-21  Jason Nye <jnye at nbnet.nb.ca>, Erik Hensema <erik.hensema at group2000.nl>

	* cancel.c (ptw32_cancel_self): New; part of the async
	cancellation implementation.
	(ptw32_cancel_thread): Ditto; this function is X86
	processor specific.
	(pthread_setcancelstate): Add check for pending async
	cancel request and cancel the calling thread if
	required; add async-cancel safety lock.
	(pthread_setcanceltype): Ditto.

1999-11-13  Erik Hensema <erik.hensema at group2000.nl>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Put generated output into GNUmakefile
	rather than Makefile. Makefile will become the MSC nmake compatible
	version

1999-11-13  John Bossom (John.Bossom@cognos.com>

	* misc.c (pthread_self): Add a note about GetCurrentThread
	returning a pseudo-handle

1999-11-10  Todd Owen <towen at lucidcalm.dropbear.id.au>

	* dll.c (dllMain): Free kernel32 ASAP.
	If TryEnterCriticalSection is not being used, then free
	the kernel32.dll handle now, rather than leaving it until
	DLL_PROCESS_DETACH.

	Note: this is not a pedantic exercise in freeing unused
	resources!  It is a work-around for a bug in Windows 95
	(see microsoft knowledge base article, Q187684) which
	does Bad Things when FreeLibrary is called within
	the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH code, in certain situations.
	Since w95 just happens to be a platform which does not
	provide TryEnterCriticalSection, the bug will be
	effortlessly avoided.

1999-11-10  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* sync.c (pthread_join): Make it a deferred cancelation point.

1999-10-21  Aurelio Medina <aureliom at crt.com>

	* pthread.h (_POSIX_THREADS): Only define it if it isn't

	* condvar.c (cond_wait_cleanup): New static cleanup handler for
	cond_timedwait;

	will now decrement the waiters count and cleanup if it's the
	last waiter.

1999-10-15  Graham Dumpleton <Graham.Dumpleton at ra.pad.otc.telstra.com.au>

	* condvar.c (cond_wait_cleanup): the last waiter will now reset the CV's
	wasBroadcast flag

1999-07-09  Lorin Hochstein <lmh at xiphos.ca>, John Bossom <John.Bossom at Cognos.COM>

	The problem was that cleanup handlers were not executed when
	pthread_exit() was called.

	* implement.h (pthread_t_): Add exceptionInformation element for
	C++ per-thread exception information.
	(general): Define and rename exceptions.

	and ptw32_exception_exit (C++) used to identify the exception.

	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Add pthread_exit exception trap;

	indexed element in the handles array. Enhance test for abandoned
	objects.

	* pthread.h (PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER): Trailing elements not
	initialised are set to zero by the compiler. This avoids the
	problem of initialising the opaque critical section element in it.
	(PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER): Ditto.

	to 0, not 1. cond_timedwait was returning signaled immediately.

	* misc.c (CancelableWait): Place the cancel event handle first
	in the handle table for WaitForMultipleObjects. This ensures that
	the cancel event is recognised and acted apon if both objects

	flag destroyed CVs as invalid.
	(pthread_cond_init): pthread_cond_t is no longer just a pointer.
	This is because PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER needs state info to reside
	in pthread_cond_t so that it can initialise on first use. Will work on
	making pthread_cond_t (and other objects like it) opaque again, if
	possible, later.
	(cond_timedwait): add check for statically initialisation of
	CV; initialise on first use.
	(pthread_cond_signal): check for valid CV.
	(pthread_cond_broadcast): check for valid CV.
	(_cond_check_need_init): Add.

	* pthread.h (PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER): Fix.

	* implement.h (class ptw32_exception): Define for C++.

	* pthread.h: Fix C, C++, and Win32 SEH condition compilation

	Define '_timeb' as 'timeb' for Ming32.
	Define PT_STDCALL as nothing for Mingw32. May be temporary.

	- from John Bossom's implementation.
	(pthread_mutex_destroy): Conditionally close Win32 mutex

	(pthread_mutexattr_getpshared): New function from John Bossom's
	implementation.
	(pthread_mutexattr_setpshared): New function from John Bossom's
	implementation.

Tue Jan 19 18:27:42 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h (pthreadCancelableTimedWait): New prototype.
	(pthreadCancelableWait): Remove second argument.

	* misc.c (CancelableWait): New static function is 
	pthreadCancelableWait() renamed.
	(pthreadCancelableWait): Now just calls CancelableWait() with
	INFINITE timeout.
	(pthreadCancelableTimedWait): Just calls CancelableWait()
	with passed in timeout.

Tue Jan 19 18:27:42 1999  Scott Lightner <scott at curriculum.com>

	* private.c (ptw32_sem_timedwait): 'abstime' arg really is
	absolute time. Calculate relative time to wait from current
	time before passing timeout to new routine 
	pthreadCancelableTimedWait().

Tue Jan 19 10:27:39 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h (pthread_mutexattr_setforcecs_np): New prototype.
	
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutexattr_init): Init 'pshared' and 'forcecs'
	attributes to 0.
	(pthread_mutexattr_setforcecs_np): New function (not portable).

	* pthread.h (pthread_mutex_t): 
	Add 'mutex' element. Set to NULL in PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER.
	The pthread_mutex_*() routines will try to optimise performance
	by choosing either mutexes or critical sections as the basis
	for pthread mutexes for each indevidual mutex.
	(pthread_mutexattr_t_): Add 'forcecs' element.
	Some applications may choose to force use of critical sections
	if they know that:-
	     the mutex is PROCESS_PRIVATE and, 
	         either the OS supports TryEnterCriticalSection() or
	         pthread_mutex_trylock() will never be called on the mutex.
	This attribute will be setable via a non-portable routine.

	Note: We don't yet support PROCESS_SHARED mutexes, so the
	implementation as it stands will default to Win32 mutexes only if
	the OS doesn't support TryEnterCriticalSection. On Win9x, and early
	versions of NT 'forcecs' will need to be set in order to get
	critical section based mutexes.

Sun Jan 17 12:01:26 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h (PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER): Init new 'staticinit'
	value to '1' and existing 'valid' value to '1'.

	* global.c (ptw32_mutex_test_init_lock): Add.

	* implement.h (ptw32_mutex_test_init_lock.): Add extern.

	* private.c (ptw32_processInitialize): Init critical section for
	global lock used by _mutex_check_need_init().
	(ptw32_processTerminate): Ditto (:s/Init/Destroy/).

	* dll.c (dllMain): Move call to FreeLibrary() so that it is only
	called once when the process detaches.

	* mutex.c (_mutex_check_need_init): New static function to test
	and init PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER mutexes. Provides serialised
	access to the internal state of the uninitialised static mutex. 
	Called from pthread_mutex_trylock() and pthread_mutex_lock() which
	do a quick unguarded test to check if _mutex_check_need_init()
	needs to be called. This is safe as the test is conservative
 	and is repeated inside the guarded section of 
	_mutex_check_need_init(). Thus in all calls except the first
	calls to lock static mutexes, the additional overhead to lock any
	mutex is a single memory fetch and test for zero.

	* pthread.h (pthread_mutex_t_): Add 'staticinit' member. Mutexes
	initialised by PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER aren't really initialised
	until the first attempt to lock it. Using the 'valid'
	flag (which flags the mutex as destroyed or not) to record this
	information would be messy. It is possible for a statically
	initialised mutex such as this to be destroyed before ever being
	used.

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_trylock): Call _mutex_check_need_init()
	to test/init PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER mutexes.
	(pthread_mutex_lock): Ditto.
	(pthread_mutex_unlock): Add check to ensure we don't try to unlock
	an unitialised static mutex.
	(pthread_mutex_destroy): Add check to ensure we don't try to delete
	a critical section that we never created. Allows us to destroy
	a static mutex that has never been locked (and hence initialised).
	(pthread_mutex_init): Set 'staticinit' flag to 0 for the new mutex.

Sun Jan 17 12:01:26 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* private.c (ptw32_sem_timedwait): Move from semaphore.c.

	* semaphore.c : Remove redundant #includes.
	(ptw32_sem_timedwait): Move to private.c.
	(sem_wait): Add missing abstime arg to pthreadCancelableWait() call.

Fri Jan 15 23:38:05 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* condvar.c (cond_timedwait): Remove comment.

Fri Jan 15 15:41:28 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* pthread.h: Add new 'abstime' arg to pthreadCancelableWait()
	prototype.

	* condvar.c (cond_timedwait): New generalised function called by
	both pthread_cond_wait() and pthread_cond_timedwait(). This is
	essentially pthread_cond_wait() renamed and modified to add the
	'abstime' arg and call the new ptw32_sem_timedwait() instead of
	sem_wait().
	(pthread_cond_wait): Now just calls the internal static
	function cond_timedwait() with an INFINITE wait.
	(pthread_cond_timedwait): Now implemented. Calls the internal
	static function cond_timedwait().

	* implement.h (ptw32_sem_timedwait): New internal function
	prototype.

	* misc.c (pthreadCancelableWait): Added new 'abstime' argument
	to allow shorter than INFINITE wait.

	* semaphore.c (ptw32_sem_timedwait): New function for internal
	use.  This is essentially sem_wait() modified to add the
        'abstime' arg and call the modified (see above)
        pthreadCancelableWait().

Thu Jan 14 14:27:13 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* cleanup.c: Correct _cplusplus to __cplusplus wherever used.

	* Makefile.in: Add CC=g++ and add -fhandle-exceptions to CFLAGS.
	The derived Makefile will compile all units of the package as C++
	so that those which include try/catch exception handling should work
	properly. The package should compile ok if CC=gcc, however, exception
	handling will not be included and thus thread cancellation, for
 	example, will not work.

	* cleanup.c (ptw32_pop_cleanup): Add #warning to compile this
 	file as C++ if using a cygwin32 environment. Perhaps the whole package
	should be compiled using g++ under cygwin.

	* private.c (ptw32_threadStart): Change #error directive
	into #warning and bracket for __CYGWIN__ and derivative compilers.

Wed Jan 13 09:34:52 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* build.bat: Delete old binaries before compiling/linking.

Tue Jan 12 09:58:38 1999  Tor Lillqvist <tml at iki.fi>

	* dll.c: The Microsoft compiler pragmas probably are more
	appropriately protected by _MSC_VER than by _WIN32.

	* pthread.h: Define ETIMEDOUT. This should be returned by
	pthread_cond_timedwait which is not implemented yet as of
	snapshot-1999-01-04-1305. It was implemented in the older version.
	The Microsoft compiler pragmas probably are more appropriately
	protected by _MSC_VER than by _WIN32.

	* pthread.def: pthread_mutex_destroy was missing from the def file

	* condvar.c (pthread_cond_broadcast): Ensure we only wait on threads
	if there were any waiting on the condition.
	I think pthread_cond_broadcast should do the WaitForSingleObject
	only if cv->waiters > 0? Otherwise it seems to hang, at least in the
	testg thread program from glib.

Tue Jan 12 09:58:38 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* condvar.c (pthread_cond_timedwait): Fix function description
	comments.

	macros.

	* cleanup.c (ptw32_push_cleanup): Provide conditional 
	compile of cleanup->prev.

1999-01-11  Tor Lillqvist <tml at iki.fi>

	* condvar.c (pthread_cond_init): Invert logic when testing the
	return value from calloc().

Sat Jan  9 14:32:08 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* implement.h: Compile-time switch for CYGWIN derived environments
	to use CreateThread instead of _beginthreadex. Ditto for ExitThread.
	Patch provided by Anders Norlander  <anorland at hem2.passagen.se>.

Tue Jan  5 16:33:04 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* cleanup.c (ptw32_pop_cleanup): Add C++ version of __try/__except
	block. Move trailing "}" out of #ifdef _WIN32 block left there by
	(rpj's) mistake.

	* private.c: Remove #include <errno.h> which is included by pthread.h.

1998-12-11  Ben Elliston  <bje at toilet.to.cygnus.com>

	* README: Update info about subscribing to the mailing list.

Mon Jan  4 11:23:40 1999  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* all: No code changes, just cleanup.

	* implement.h: Move the following struct definitions to pthread.h:
	pthread_t_, pthread_attr_t_, pthread_mutex_t_, pthread_mutex_t_,
	pthread_mutexattr_t_, pthread_key_t_, pthread_cond_t_,
	pthread_condattr_t_, pthread_once_t_.

	* pthread.h: Add "_" prefix to pthread_push_cleanup and 
	pthread_pop_cleanup internal routines, and associated struct and
	typedefs.

	* buildlib.bat: Add compile command for semaphore.c

	* pthread.def: Comment out pthread_atfork routine name.

	now a **.
	(pthread_attr_getschedparam): Ditto.
	(pthread_setschedparam): Change thread validation and rename "thread"
 	Win32 thread Handle element name to match John Bossom's version.

	to ptw32_threadStart and ptw32_threadDestroy.

	* implement.h: Rename "detachedstate" to "detachstate".

	* attr.c: Rename "detachedstate" to "detachstate".

Sun Dec 20 14:51:58 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* misc.c (pthreadCancelableWait): New function by John Bossom. Non-standard
	but provides a hook that can be used to implement cancellation points in
	applications that use this library.

	* pthread.h (pthread_cleanup_pop): C++ (non-WIN32) version uses
	try/catch to emulate John Bossom's WIN32 __try/__finally behaviour.
	In the WIN32 version __finally block, add a test for AbnormalTermination otherwise
	cleanup is only run if the cleanup_pop execute arg is non-zero. Cancellation
	should cause the cleanup to run irrespective of the execute arg.

	* condvar.c (pthread_condattr_init): Replaced by John Bossom's version.
	(pthread_condattr_destroy): Replaced by John Bossom's version.
	(pthread_condattr_getpshared): Replaced by John Bossom's version.

Sun Dec  6 21:54:35 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	* buildlib.bat: Fix args to CL when building the .DLL

	* cleanup.c (ptw32_destructor_run_all): Fix TSD key management.
	This is a tidy-up before TSD and Thread management is completely
	replaced by John Bossom's code.

	* tsd.c (pthread_key_create): Fix TSD key management.

	* global.c (ptw32_key_virgin_next): Initialise.

	* process.h: Remove. This was a stand-in before we started doing
	native compilation under Win32.

	* pthread.h (pthread_mutex_init): Make `attr' argument const.

	(  PTW32_NEW, PTW32_INUSE, PTW32_EXITED, PTW32_REUSE):
	Add.


	* create.c (pthread_create): Minor rename "us" to "new" (I need
	these cues but it doesn't stop me coming out with some major bugs
	at times).
	Load start_routine and arg into the thread so the wrapper can

	complete.

	* implement.h (ptw32_threads_thread): Rename, remove thread
	member, add win32handle and ptstatus members.
	(ptw32_t): Add.

	* pthread.h: pthread_t is no longer mapped directly to a Win32
	HANDLE type. This is so we can let the Win32 thread terminate and
	reuse the HANDLE while pthreads holds it's own thread ID until
	the last waiting join exits.

Mon Jul 27 00:20:37 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj at ixobrychus.canberra.edu.au>

	(ptw32_delete_thread_entry): Ditto.
	(ptw32_exit): Add prototype.

	* exit.c (ptw32_exit): New function. Called from pthread_exit()
	and ptw32_start_call() to exit the thread. It allows an extra
	argument which is the return code passed to _endthreadex().
	(ptw32_exit): Move thread entry delete call from ptw32_vacuum()
	into here. Add more explanation of thread entry deletion.
	(ptw32_exit): Clarify comment.

	manipulation code. This routine now calls _enthreadex().

	* create.c (ptw32_start_call): Remove setjmp() call and move
	cleanup code out. Call pthread_exit(NULL) to terminate the thread.

1998-07-26  Ben Elliston  <bje at cygnus.com>

	point to both pthread_cond_wait() and pthread_cond_timedwait().

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Rename "this" to "us".

	* implement.h: Add comment.

	* sync.c (pthread_join): I've satisfied myself that pthread_detach()
	does set the detached attribute in the thread entry attributes
	to PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED. "if" conditions were changed to test
	that attribute instead of a separate flag.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Rename "this" to "us".
	(pthread_create): cancelstate and canceltype are not attributes
	so the copy to thread entry attribute storage was removed.
	Only the thread itself can change it's cancelstate or canceltype,
	ie. the thread must exist already.

	* private.c (ptw32_delete_thread_entry): Mutex locks removed.
	Mutexes must be applied at the caller level.

	(pthread_create): New threads inherit their creator's signal
	mask.  Copy the signal mask to the new thread structure if we know
	about signals.
	
Fri Jul 24 16:33:17 1998  Ross Johnson  <rpj at swan.canberra.edu.au>

	* fork.c (pthread_atfork): Add all the necessary push calls.
	Local implementation semantics:

	* create.c (ptw32_start_call): Rewrite to facilitate joins.
	pthread_exit() will do a longjmp() back to here. Does appropriate
	cleanup and exit/return from the thread.
	(pthread_create): _beginthreadex() now passes a pointer to our
	thread table entry instead of just the call member of that entry.

	* implement.h (ptw32_threads_thread): New member 
	void ** joinvalueptr.
	(ptw32_call_t): New member jmpbuf env.

	changed. See next entry. Move mutex locks out. Changes made yesterday
	and today allow us to start the new thread running rather than
	temporarily suspended.

	* private.c (ptw32_new_thread_entry): ptw32_thread_table
	was changed back to a table of thread structures rather than pointers.
	As such we're trading storage for increaded speed. This routine
	was modified to work with the new table. Mutex lock put in around
	global data accesses.
	(ptw32_find_thread_entry): Ditto

	ptw32_thread_thread_t *.
	(ptw32_new_thread_entry): Internal changes.
	(ptw32_delete_thread_entry): Internal changes to avoid contention.
 	Calling routines changed accordingly.

	* pthread.h: Modified cleanup macros to use new generic push and pop.
	Added destructor and atfork stacks to ptw32_threads_thread_t.

	* cleanup.c (ptw32_handler_push, ptw32_handler_pop,
	ptw32_handler_pop_all): Renamed cleanup push and pop routines
	and made generic to handle destructors and atfork handlers as
	well.

	* create.c (ptw32_start_call): New function is a wrapper for
	all new threads. It allows us to do some cleanup when the thread
	returns, ie. that is otherwise only done if the thread is cancelled.

	* exit.c (ptw32_vacuum): New function contains code from 
	pthread_exit() that we need in the new ptw32_start_call()
	as well.

	* private.c (ptw32_find_thread_entry): Implement.
	(ptw32_delete_thread_entry): Implement.
	(ptw32_new_thread_entry): Implement.
	These functions manipulate the implementations internal thread
	table and are part of general code cleanup and modularisation.
	They replace ptw32_getthreadindex() which was removed.

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Changed to use the new code above.

	* pthread.h: Add cancelability constants. Update comments.

1998-07-22  Ben Elliston  <bje at cygnus.com>

	are macros. See below.

	* pthread.h (pthread_cleanup_push): Implement as a macro.
	(pthread_cleanup_pop): Implement as a macro.
	Because these are macros which start and end a block, the POSIX scoping
	requirement is observed. See the comment in the file.

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Refine the code.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Code cleanup.

	* implement.h (RND_SIZEOF): Add RND_SIZEOF(T) to round sizeof(T)
	up to multiple of DWORD.
	Add function prototypes.

	* private.c (ptw32_getthreadindex): "*thread" should have been 
	"thread". Detect empty slot fail condition.

	* misc.c (pthread_once): Implement.  Don't use a per-application
	flag and mutex--make `pthread_once_t' contain these elements in

	and PTW32_HASH_INDEX.

	* exit.c (pthread_exit): Begin work on cleanup and de-allocate
	thread-private storage.

	* create.c (pthread_create): Add thread to thread table.
	Keep a thread-private copy of the attributes with default values
	filled in when necessary. Same for the cleanup stack. Make 
	pthread_create C run-time library friendly by using _beginthreadex()
	instead of CreateThread(). Fix error returns.

	* mutex.c (pthread_mutex_trylock): Return ENOSYS if this function
	is called on a Win32 platform which is not Windows NT.

1998-07-18  Ben Elliston  <bje at cygnus.com>

	* condvar.c (pthread_condattr_init): Do not attempt to malloc any
	storage; none is needed now that condattr_t is an empty struct.
	(pthread_condattr_destory): Likewise; do not free storage.
	(pthread_condattr_setpshared): No longer supported; return ENOSYS.
	(pthread_condattr_getpshared): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_init): Implement with help from Douglas Schmidt.
	Remember to initialise the cv's internal mutex.
	(pthread_cond_wait): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_signal): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_broadcast): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_timedwait): Preliminary implementation, but I need
	to see some API documentation for `WaitForMultipleObject'.
	(pthread_destory): Implement.

	* pthread.h (pthread_cond_init): Add function protoype.

	(pthread_cond_signal): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_timedwait): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_wait): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_destroy): Likewise.
	(pthread_cond_t): Define this type.  Fix for u_int.  Do not assume
	that the mutex contained withing the pthread_cond_t structure will
	be a critical section.  Use our new POSIX type!

	* implement.h (ptw32_condattr_t): Remove shared attribute.

1998-07-17  Ben Elliston  <bje at cygnus.com>

	* pthread.h (PTHREADS_PROCESS_PRIVATE): Remove.
	(PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED): Likewise.  No support for mutexes shared
	across processes for now.
	(pthread_mutex_t): Use a Win32 CRITICAL_SECTION type for better
	performance.
	
	* implement.h (ptw32_mutexattr_t): Remove shared attribute.
	
	* mutex.c (pthread_mutexattr_setpshared): This optional function
	is no longer supported, since we want to implement POSIX mutex
	variables using the much more efficient Win32 critical section
	primitives.  Critical section objects in Win32 cannot be shared
	between processes.
	(pthread_mutexattr_getpshared): Likewise.
	(pthread_mutexattr_init): No need to malloc any storage; the
	attributes structure is now empty.
	(pthread_mutexattr_destroy): This is now a nop.
	(pthread_mutex_init): Use InitializeCriticalSection().
	(pthread_mutex_destroy): Use DeleteCriticalSection().
	(pthread_mutex_lock): Use EnterCriticalSection().
	(pthread_mutex_trylock): Use TryEnterCriticalSection().  This is
	not supported by Windows 9x, but trylock is a hack anyway, IMHO.
	(pthread_mutex_unlock): Use LeaveCriticalSection().
