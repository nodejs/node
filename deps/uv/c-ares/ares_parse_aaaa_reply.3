.TH ARES_PARSE_AAAA_REPLY 3 "20 Nov 2009"
.SH NAME
ares_parse_aaaa_reply \- Parse a reply to a DNS query of type AAAA
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <ares.h>
.PP
.B int ares_parse_aaaa_reply(const unsigned char *\fIabuf\fP, int \fIalen\fP,
.B 	struct hostent **\fIhost\fP,         
.B      struct ares_addr6ttl *\fIaddrttls\fB, int *\fInaddrttls\fB);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ares_parse_aaaa_reply
function parses the response to a query of type AAAA into a
.BR "struct hostent"
and/or an array of
.BR "struct ares_addr6ttl" . 
The parameters
.I abuf
and
.I alen
give the contents of the response.  The result is stored in allocated
memory and a pointer to it stored into the variable pointed to by
.IR host ,
if host is nonnull.
It is the caller's responsibility to free the resulting host structure
using
.BR ares_free_hostent (3)
when it is no longer needed.
.PP
If
.IR addrttls
and
.IR naddrttls
are both nonnull,
then up to *naddrttls
.BR "struct ares_addr6ttl"
records are stored in the array pointed to by addrttls,
and then *naddrttls is set to the number of records so stored.
Note that the memory for these records is supplied by the caller.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.B ares_parse_aaaa_reply
can return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
The response was successfully parsed.
.TP 15
.B ARES_EBADRESP
