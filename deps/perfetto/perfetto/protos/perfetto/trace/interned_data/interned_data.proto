// ------------------------------ DATA INTERNING: ------------------------------
// Interning indexes are built up gradually by adding the entries contained in
// each TracePacket of the same packet sequence (packets emitted by the same
// producer and TraceWriter, see |trusted_packet_sequence_id|). Thus, packets
// can only refer to interned data from other packets in the same sequence.
//
// The writer will emit new entries when it encounters new internable values
// that aren't yet in the index. Data in current and subsequent TracePackets can
// then refer to the entry by its position (interning ID, abbreviated "iid") in
// its index. An interning ID with value 0 is considered invalid (not set).
//
// Because of the incremental build-up, the interning index will miss data when
// TracePackets are lost, e.g. because a chunk was overridden in the central
// ring buffer. To avoid invalidation of the whole trace in such a case, the
// index is periodically reset (see SEQ_INCREMENTAL_STATE_CLEARED).
// When packet loss occurs, the reader will only lose interning data up to the
// next reset.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Message that contains new entries for the interning indices of a packet
// sequence.
//
// The writer will usually emit new entries in the same TracePacket that first
// refers to them (since the last reset of interning state). They may also be
// emitted proactively in advance of referring to them in later packets.
//
// Next reserved id: 8 (up to 15).
// Next id: 23.

  // Each field's message type needs to specify an |iid| field, which is the ID
  // of the entry in the field's interning index. Each field constructs its own
  // index, thus interning IDs are scoped to the tracing session and field
  // (usually as a counter for efficient var-int encoding). It is illegal to
  // override entries in an index (using the same iid for two different values)
  // within the same tracing session, even after a reset of the emitted
  // interning state.
