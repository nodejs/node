/**
 * <code>CalendarAstronomer</code> is a class that can perform the calculations to
 * determine the positions of the sun and moon, the time of sunrise and
 * sunset, and other astronomy-related data.  The calculations it performs
 * are in some cases quite complicated, and this utility class saves you
 * the trouble of worrying about them.
 * <p>
 * The measurement of time is a very important part of astronomy.  Because
 * astronomical bodies are constantly in motion, observations are only valid
 * at a given moment in time.  Accordingly, each <code>CalendarAstronomer</code>
 * object has a <code>time</code> property that determines the date
 * and time for which its calculations are performed.  You can set and
 * retrieve this property with {@link #setTime setTime}, {@link #getTime getTime}
 * and related methods.
 * <p>
 * Almost all of the calculations performed by this class, or by any
 * astronomer, are approximations to various degrees of accuracy.  The
 * calculations in this class are mostly modelled after those described
 * in the book
 * <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0521356997" target="_top">
 * Practical Astronomy With Your Calculator</a>, by Peter J.
 * Duffett-Smith, Cambridge University Press, 1990.  This is an excellent
 * book, and if you want a greater understanding of how these calculations
 * are performed it a very good, readable starting point.
 * <p>
 * <strong>WARNING:</strong> This class is very early in its development, and
 * it is highly likely that its API will change to some degree in the future.
 * At the moment, it basically does just enough to support {@link IslamicCalendar}
 * and {@link ChineseCalendar}.
