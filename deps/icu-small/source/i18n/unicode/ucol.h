 * \brief C API: Collator 
 *
 * <h2> Collator C API </h2>
 *
 * The C API for Collator performs locale-sensitive
 * string comparison. You use this service to build
 * searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
 * <p>
 * For more information about the collation service see 
 * <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation">the User Guide</a>.
 * <p>
 * Collation service provides correct sorting orders for most locales supported in ICU. 
 * If specific data for a locale is not available, the orders eventually falls back
 * to the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#Root_Collation">CLDR root sort order</a>. 
 * <p>
 * Sort ordering may be customized by providing your own set of rules. For more on
 * this subject see the <a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/customization">
 * Collation Customization</a> section of the User Guide.
 * <p>

 * Merges two sort keys. The levels are merged with their corresponding counterparts
 * (primaries with primaries, secondaries with secondaries etc.). Between the values
 * from the same level a separator is inserted.
 *
 * This is useful, for example, for combining sort keys from first and last names
 * to sort such pairs.
 * See http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Merging_Sort_Keys
 *
 * The recommended way to achieve "merged" sorting is by
 * concatenating strings with U+FFFE between them.
 * The concatenation has the same sort order as the merged sort keys,
 * but merge(getSortKey(str1), getSortKey(str2)) may differ from getSortKey(str1 + '\uFFFE' + str2).
 * Using strings with U+FFFE may yield shorter sort keys.
 *
 * For details about Sort Key Features see
 * http://userguide.icu-project.org/collation/api#TOC-Sort-Key-Features
 *
 * It is possible to merge multiple sort keys by consecutively merging
 * another one with the intermediate result.
 *
 * The length of the merge result is the sum of the lengths of the input sort keys.
 *
 * Example (uncompressed):
 * <pre>191B1D 01 050505 01 910505 00
 * 1F2123 01 050505 01 910505 00</pre>
 * will be merged as 
 * <pre>191B1D 02 1F2123 01 050505 02 050505 01 910505 02 910505 00</pre>
 *
 * If the destination buffer is not big enough, then its contents are undefined.
 * If any of source lengths are zero or any of the source pointers are NULL/undefined,
 * the result is of size zero.
 *
 * @param src1 the first sort key
 * @param src1Length the length of the first sort key, including the zero byte at the end;
 *        can be -1 if the function is to find the length
 * @param src2 the second sort key
 * @param src2Length the length of the second sort key, including the zero byte at the end;
 *        can be -1 if the function is to find the length
 * @param dest the buffer where the merged sort key is written,
 *        can be NULL if destCapacity==0
 * @param destCapacity the number of bytes in the dest buffer
 * @return the length of the merged sort key, src1Length+src2Length;
 *         can be larger than destCapacity, or 0 if an error occurs (only for illegal arguments),
 *         in which cases the contents of dest is undefined
