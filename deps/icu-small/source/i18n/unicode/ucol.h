 * \brief C API: Collator 
 *
 * <h2> Collator C API </h2>
 *
 * The C API for Collator performs locale-sensitive
 * string comparison. You use this service to build
 * searching and sorting routines for natural language text.
 * <p>
 * For more information about the collation service see 
 * <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation">the User Guide</a>.
 * <p>
 * Collation service provides correct sorting orders for most locales supported in ICU. 
 * If specific data for a locale is not available, the orders eventually falls back
 * to the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#Root_Collation">CLDR root sort order</a>. 
 * <p>
 * Sort ordering may be customized by providing your own set of rules. For more on
 * this subject see the <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation/customization">
 * Collation Customization</a> section of the User Guide.
 * <p>

 * Merges two sort keys. The levels are merged with their corresponding counterparts

 *
 * This is useful, for example, for combining sort keys from first and last names
 * to sort such pairs.
 * See http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Merging_Sort_Keys
 *
 * The recommended way to achieve "merged" sorting is by
 * concatenating strings with U+FFFE between them.
 * The concatenation has the same sort order as the merged sort keys,
 * but merge(getSortKey(str1), getSortKey(str2)) may differ from getSortKey(str1 + '\\uFFFE' + str2).
 * Using strings with U+FFFE may yield shorter sort keys.
 *
 * For details about Sort Key Features see
 * https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/collation/api#sort-key-features
 *
 * It is possible to merge multiple sort keys by consecutively merging
 * another one with the intermediate result.
 *
 * The length of the merge result is the sum of the lengths of the input sort keys.
 *
 * Example (uncompressed):
 * <pre>191B1D 01 050505 01 910505 00
 * 1F2123 01 050505 01 910505 00</pre>
