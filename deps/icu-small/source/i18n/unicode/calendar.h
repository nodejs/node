/**
 * `Calendar` is an abstract base class for converting between
 * a `UDate` object and a set of integer fields such as
 * `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, and so on.
 * (A `UDate` object represents a specific instant in
 * time with millisecond precision. See UDate
 * for information about the `UDate` class.)
 *
 * Subclasses of `Calendar` interpret a `UDate`
 * according to the rules of a specific calendar system.
 * The most commonly used subclass of `Calendar` is
 * `GregorianCalendar`. Other subclasses could represent
 * the various types of lunar calendars in use in many parts of the world.
 *
 * **NOTE**: (ICU 2.6) The subclass interface should be considered unstable -
 * it WILL change.
 *
 * Like other locale-sensitive classes, `Calendar` provides a
 * static method, `createInstance`, for getting a generally useful
 * object of this type. `Calendar`'s `createInstance` method
 * returns the appropriate `Calendar` subclass whose
 * time fields have been initialized with the current date and time:
 *
 *     Calendar *rightNow = Calendar::createInstance(errCode);
 *
 * A `Calendar` object can produce all the time field values
 * needed to implement the date-time formatting for a particular language
 * and calendar style (for example, Japanese-Gregorian, Japanese-Traditional).
 *
 * When computing a `UDate` from time fields, some special circumstances
 * may arise: there may be insufficient information to compute the
 * `UDate` (such as only year and month but no day in the month),
 * there may be inconsistent information (such as "Tuesday, July 15, 1996"
 * -- July 15, 1996 is actually a Monday), or the input time might be ambiguous
 * because of time zone transition.
 *
 * **Insufficient information.** The calendar will use default
 * information to specify the missing fields. This may vary by calendar; for
 * the Gregorian calendar, the default for a field is the same as that of the
 * start of the epoch: i.e., YEAR = 1970, MONTH = JANUARY, DATE = 1, etc.
 *
 * **Inconsistent information.** If fields conflict, the calendar
 * will give preference to fields set more recently. For example, when
 * determining the day, the calendar will look for one of the following
 * combinations of fields.  The most recent combination, as determined by the
 * most recently set single field, will be used.
 *
 *     MONTH + DAY_OF_MONTH
 *     MONTH + WEEK_OF_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
 *     MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK_IN_MONTH + DAY_OF_WEEK
 *     DAY_OF_YEAR
 *     DAY_OF_WEEK + WEEK_OF_YEAR
 *
 * For the time of day:
 *
 *     HOUR_OF_DAY
 *     AM_PM + HOUR
 *
 * **Ambiguous Wall Clock Time.** When time offset from UTC has
 * changed, it produces an ambiguous time slot around the transition. For example,
 * many US locations observe daylight saving time. On the date switching to daylight
 * saving time in US, wall clock time jumps from 12:59 AM (standard) to 2:00 AM
 * (daylight). Therefore, wall clock time from 1:00 AM to 1:59 AM do not exist on
 * the date. When the input wall time fall into this missing time slot, the ICU
 * Calendar resolves the time using the UTC offset before the transition by default.
 * In this example, 1:30 AM is interpreted as 1:30 AM standard time (non-exist),
 * so the final result will be 2:30 AM daylight time.
 *
 * On the date switching back to standard time, wall clock time is moved back one
 * hour at 2:00 AM. So wall clock time from 1:00 AM to 1:59 AM occur twice. In this
 * case, the ICU Calendar resolves the time using the UTC offset after the transition
 * by default. For example, 1:30 AM on the date is resolved as 1:30 AM standard time.
 *
 * Ambiguous wall clock time resolution behaviors can be customized by Calendar APIs
 * {@link #setRepeatedWallTimeOption} and {@link #setSkippedWallTimeOption}.
 * These methods are available in ICU 49 or later versions.
 *
 * **Note:** for some non-Gregorian calendars, different
 * fields may be necessary for complete disambiguation. For example, a full
 * specification of the historical Arabic astronomical calendar requires year,
 * month, day-of-month *and* day-of-week in some cases.
 *
 * **Note:** There are certain possible ambiguities in
 * interpretation of certain singular times, which are resolved in the
 * following ways:
 *
 *   1. 24:00:00 "belongs" to the following day. That is,
 *      23:59 on Dec 31, 1969 < 24:00 on Jan 1, 1970 < 24:01:00 on Jan 1, 1970
 *   2. Although historically not precise, midnight also belongs to "am",
 *      and noon belongs to "pm", so on the same day,
 *      12:00 am (midnight) < 12:01 am, and 12:00 pm (noon) < 12:01 pm
 *
 * The date or time format strings are not part of the definition of a
 * calendar, as those must be modifiable or overridable by the user at
 * runtime. Use `DateFormat` to format dates.
 *
 * `Calendar` provides an API for field "rolling", where fields
 * can be incremented or decremented, but wrap around. For example, rolling the
 * month up in the date December 12, **1996** results in
 * January 12, **1996**.
 *
 * `Calendar` also provides a date arithmetic function for
 * adding the specified (signed) amount of time to a particular time field.
 * For example, subtracting 5 days from the date `September 12, 1996`
 * results in `September 7, 1996`.
 *
 * ***Supported range***
 *
 * The allowable range of `Calendar` has been narrowed. `GregorianCalendar` used
 * to attempt to support the range of dates with millisecond values from
 * `Long.MIN_VALUE` to `Long.MAX_VALUE`. The new `Calendar` protocol specifies the
 * maximum range of supportable dates as those having Julian day numbers
 * of `-0x7F000000` to `+0x7F000000`. This corresponds to years from ~5,800,000 BCE
 * to ~5,800,000 CE. Programmers should use the protected constants in `Calendar` to
 * specify an extremely early or extremely late date.
 *
 * <p>
 * The Japanese calendar uses a combination of era name and year number.
 * When an emperor of Japan abdicates and a new emperor ascends the throne,
 * a new era is declared and year number is reset to 1. Even if the date of
 * abdication is scheduled ahead of time, the new era name might not be
 * announced until just before the date. In such case, ICU4C may include
 * a start date of future era without actual era name, but not enabled
 * by default. ICU4C users who want to test the behavior of the future era
 * can enable the tentative era by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Environment variable <code>ICU_ENABLE_TENTATIVE_ERA=true</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
