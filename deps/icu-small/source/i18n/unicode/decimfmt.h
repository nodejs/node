/**
 * **IMPORTANT:** New users are strongly encouraged to see if
 * numberformatter.h fits their use case.  Although not deprecated, this header
 * is provided for backwards compatibility only.
 *
 * DecimalFormat is a concrete subclass of NumberFormat that formats decimal
 * numbers. It has a variety of features designed to make it possible to parse
 * and format numbers in any locale, including support for Western, Arabic, or
 * Indic digits.  It also supports different flavors of numbers, including
 * integers ("123"), fixed-point numbers ("123.4"), scientific notation
 * ("1.23E4"), percentages ("12%"), and currency amounts ("$123", "USD123",
 * "123 US dollars").  All of these flavors can be easily localized.
 *
 * To obtain a NumberFormat for a specific locale (including the default
 * locale) call one of NumberFormat's factory methods such as
 * createInstance(). Do not call the DecimalFormat constructors directly, unless
 * you know what you are doing, since the NumberFormat factory methods may
 * return subclasses other than DecimalFormat.
 *
 * **Example Usage**
 *
 * \code
 *     // Normally we would have a GUI with a menu for this
 *     int32_t locCount;
 *     const Locale* locales = NumberFormat::getAvailableLocales(locCount);
 *
 *     double myNumber = -1234.56;
 *     UErrorCode success = U_ZERO_ERROR;
 *     NumberFormat* form;
 *
 *     // Print out a number with the localized number, currency and percent
 *     // format for each locale.
 *     UnicodeString countryName;
 *     UnicodeString displayName;
 *     UnicodeString str;
 *     UnicodeString pattern;
 *     Formattable fmtable;
 *     for (int32_t j = 0; j < 3; ++j) {
 *         cout << endl << "FORMAT " << j << endl;
 *         for (int32_t i = 0; i < locCount; ++i) {
 *             if (locales[i].getCountry(countryName).size() == 0) {
 *                 // skip language-only
 *                 continue;
 *             }
 *             switch (j) {
 *             case 0:
 *                 form = NumberFormat::createInstance(locales[i], success ); break;
 *             case 1:
 *                 form = NumberFormat::createCurrencyInstance(locales[i], success ); break;
 *             default:
 *                 form = NumberFormat::createPercentInstance(locales[i], success ); break;
 *             }
 *             if (form) {
 *                 str.remove();
 *                 pattern = ((DecimalFormat*)form)->toPattern(pattern);
 *                 cout << locales[i].getDisplayName(displayName) << ": " << pattern;
 *                 cout << "  ->  " << form->format(myNumber,str) << endl;
 *                 form->parse(form->format(myNumber,str), fmtable, success);
 *                 delete form;
 *             }
 *         }
 *     }
 * \endcode
 *
 * **Another example use createInstance(style)**
 *
 * \code
 * // Print out a number using the localized number, currency,
 * // percent, scientific, integer, iso currency, and plural currency
 * // format for each locale</strong>
 * Locale* locale = new Locale("en", "US");
 * double myNumber = 1234.56;
 * UErrorCode success = U_ZERO_ERROR;
 * UnicodeString str;
 * Formattable fmtable;
 * for (int j=NumberFormat::kNumberStyle;
 *      j<=NumberFormat::kPluralCurrencyStyle;
 *      ++j) {
 *     NumberFormat* form = NumberFormat::createInstance(locale, j, success);
 *     str.remove();
 *     cout << "format result " << form->format(myNumber, str) << endl;
 *     format->parse(form->format(myNumber, str), fmtable, success);
 *     delete form;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * <p><strong>Patterns</strong>
 *
 * <p>A DecimalFormat consists of a <em>pattern</em> and a set of
 * <em>symbols</em>.  The pattern may be set directly using
 * applyPattern(), or indirectly using other API methods which
 * manipulate aspects of the pattern, such as the minimum number of integer
 * digits.  The symbols are stored in a DecimalFormatSymbols
 * object.  When using the NumberFormat factory methods, the
 * pattern and symbols are read from ICU's locale data.
 *
 * <p><strong>Special Pattern Characters</strong>
 *
 * <p>Many characters in a pattern are taken literally; they are matched during
 * parsing and output unchanged during formatting.  Special characters, on the
 * other hand, stand for other characters, strings, or classes of characters.
 * For example, the '#' character is replaced by a localized digit.  Often the
 * replacement character is the same as the pattern character; in the U.S. locale,
 * the ',' grouping character is replaced by ','.  However, the replacement is
 * still happening, and if the symbols are modified, the grouping character
 * changes.  Some special characters affect the behavior of the formatter by
 * their presence; for example, if the percent character is seen, then the
 * value is multiplied by 100 before being displayed.
 *
 * <p>To insert a special character in a pattern as a literal, that is, without
 * any special meaning, the character must be quoted.  There are some exceptions to
 * this which are noted below.
 *
 * <p>The characters listed here are used in non-localized patterns.  Localized
 * patterns use the corresponding characters taken from this formatter's
 * DecimalFormatSymbols object instead, and these characters lose
 * their special status.  Two exceptions are the currency sign and quote, which
 * are not localized.

 *
 * <p>A DecimalFormat pattern contains a positive and negative
 * subpattern, for example, "#,##0.00;(#,##0.00)".  Each subpattern has a
 * prefix, a numeric part, and a suffix.  If there is no explicit negative
 * subpattern, the negative subpattern is the localized minus sign prefixed to the
 * positive subpattern. That is, "0.00" alone is equivalent to "0.00;-0.00".  If there
 * is an explicit negative subpattern, it serves only to specify the negative
 * prefix and suffix; the number of digits, minimal digits, and other
 * characteristics are ignored in the negative subpattern. That means that
 * "#,##0.0#;(#)" has precisely the same result as "#,##0.0#;(#,##0.0#)".
 *
 * <p>The prefixes, suffixes, and various symbols used for infinity, digits,
 * thousands separators, decimal separators, etc. may be set to arbitrary
 * values, and they will appear properly during formatting.  However, care must
 * be taken that the symbols and strings do not conflict, or parsing will be
 * unreliable.  For example, either the positive and negative prefixes or the
 * suffixes must be distinct for parse() to be able
 * to distinguish positive from negative values.  Another example is that the
 * decimal separator and thousands separator should be distinct characters, or
 * parsing will be impossible.
 *
 * <p>The <em>grouping separator</em> is a character that separates clusters of
 * integer digits to make large numbers more legible.  It commonly used for
 * thousands, but in some locales it separates ten-thousands.  The <em>grouping
 * size</em> is the number of digits between the grouping separators, such as 3
 * for "100,000,000" or 4 for "1 0000 0000". There are actually two different
 * grouping sizes: One used for the least significant integer digits, the
 * <em>primary grouping size</em>, and one used for all others, the
 * <em>secondary grouping size</em>.  In most locales these are the same, but
 * sometimes they are different. For example, if the primary grouping interval
 * is 3, and the secondary is 2, then this corresponds to the pattern
 * "#,##,##0", and the number 123456789 is formatted as "12,34,56,789".  If a
 * pattern contains multiple grouping separators, the interval between the last
 * one and the end of the integer defines the primary grouping size, and the
 * interval between the last two defines the secondary grouping size. All others
 * are ignored, so "#,##,###,####" == "###,###,####" == "##,#,###,####".
 *
 * <p>Illegal patterns, such as "#.#.#" or "#.###,###", will cause
 * DecimalFormat to set a failing UErrorCode.
 *
 * <p><strong>Pattern BNF</strong>
 *
 * <pre>
 * pattern    := subpattern (';' subpattern)?
 * subpattern := prefix? number exponent? suffix?
 * number     := (integer ('.' fraction)?) | sigDigits
 * prefix     := '\\u0000'..'\\uFFFD' - specialCharacters
 * suffix     := '\\u0000'..'\\uFFFD' - specialCharacters
 * integer    := '#'* '0'* '0'
 * fraction   := '0'* '#'*
 * sigDigits  := '#'* '@' '@'* '#'*
 * exponent   := 'E' '+'? '0'* '0'
 * padSpec    := '*' padChar
 * padChar    := '\\u0000'..'\\uFFFD' - quote
 * &nbsp;
 * Notation:
 *   X*       0 or more instances of X
 *   X?       0 or 1 instances of X
 *   X|Y      either X or Y
 *   C..D     any character from C up to D, inclusive
 *   S-T      characters in S, except those in T
 * </pre>
 * The first subpattern is for positive numbers. The second (optional)
 * subpattern is for negative numbers.
 *
 * <p>Not indicated in the BNF syntax above:
 *
 * <ul><li>The grouping separator ',' can occur inside the integer and
 * sigDigits elements, between any two pattern characters of that
 * element, as long as the integer or sigDigits element is not
 * followed by the exponent element.
 *
 * <li>Two grouping intervals are recognized: That between the
 *     decimal point and the first grouping symbol, and that
 *     between the first and second grouping symbols. These
 *     intervals are identical in most locales, but in some
 *     locales they differ. For example, the pattern
 *     &quot;#,##,###&quot; formats the number 123456789 as
 *     &quot;12,34,56,789&quot;.</li>
 *
 * <li>The pad specifier <code>padSpec</code> may appear before the prefix,
 * after the prefix, before the suffix, after the suffix, or not at all.
 *
 * <li>In place of '0', the digits '1' through '9' may be used to
 * indicate a rounding increment.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Parsing</strong>
 *
 * <p>DecimalFormat parses all Unicode characters that represent
 * decimal digits, as defined by u_charDigitValue().  In addition,
 * DecimalFormat also recognizes as digits the ten consecutive
 * characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in the
 * DecimalFormatSymbols object.  During formatting, the
 * DecimalFormatSymbols-based digits are output.
 *
 * <p>During parsing, grouping separators are ignored if in lenient mode;
 * otherwise, if present, they must be in appropriate positions.
 *
 * <p>For currency parsing, the formatter is able to parse every currency
 * style formats no matter which style the formatter is constructed with.
 * For example, a formatter instance gotten from
 * NumberFormat.getInstance(ULocale, NumberFormat.CURRENCYSTYLE) can parse
 * formats such as "USD1.00" and "3.00 US dollars".
 *
 * <p>If parse(UnicodeString&,Formattable&,ParsePosition&)
 * fails to parse a string, it leaves the parse position unchanged.
 * The convenience method parse(UnicodeString&,Formattable&,UErrorCode&)
 * indicates parse failure by setting a failing
 * UErrorCode.
 *
 * <p><strong>Formatting</strong>
 *
 * <p>Formatting is guided by several parameters, all of which can be
 * specified either using a pattern or using the API.  The following
 * description applies to formats that do not use <a href="#sci">scientific
 * notation</a> or <a href="#sigdig">significant digits</a>.
 *
 * <ul><li>If the number of actual integer digits exceeds the
 * <em>maximum integer digits</em>, then only the least significant
 * digits are shown.  For example, 1997 is formatted as "97" if the
 * maximum integer digits is set to 2.
 *
 * <li>If the number of actual integer digits is less than the
 * <em>minimum integer digits</em>, then leading zeros are added.  For
 * example, 1997 is formatted as "01997" if the minimum integer digits
 * is set to 5.
 *
 * <li>If the number of actual fraction digits exceeds the <em>maximum
 * fraction digits</em>, then rounding is performed to the
 * maximum fraction digits.  For example, 0.125 is formatted as "0.12"
 * if the maximum fraction digits is 2.  This behavior can be changed
 * by specifying a rounding increment and/or a rounding mode.
 *
 * <li>If the number of actual fraction digits is less than the
 * <em>minimum fraction digits</em>, then trailing zeros are added.
 * For example, 0.125 is formatted as "0.1250" if the minimum fraction
 * digits is set to 4.
 *
 * <li>Trailing fractional zeros are not displayed if they occur
 * <em>j</em> positions after the decimal, where <em>j</em> is less
 * than the maximum fraction digits. For example, 0.10004 is
 * formatted as "0.1" if the maximum fraction digits is four or less.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Special Values</strong>
 *
 * <p><code>NaN</code> is represented as a single character, typically
 * <code>\\uFFFD</code>.  This character is determined by the
 * DecimalFormatSymbols object.  This is the only value for which
 * the prefixes and suffixes are not used.
 *
 * <p>Infinity is represented as a single character, typically
 * <code>\\u221E</code>, with the positive or negative prefixes and suffixes
 * applied.  The infinity character is determined by the
 * DecimalFormatSymbols object.
 *
 * <a name="sci"><strong>Scientific Notation</strong></a>
 *
 * <p>Numbers in scientific notation are expressed as the product of a mantissa
 * and a power of ten, for example, 1234 can be expressed as 1.234 x 10<sup>3</sup>. The
 * mantissa is typically in the half-open interval [1.0, 10.0) or sometimes [0.0, 1.0),
 * but it need not be.  DecimalFormat supports arbitrary mantissas.
 * DecimalFormat can be instructed to use scientific
 * notation through the API or through the pattern.  In a pattern, the exponent
 * character immediately followed by one or more digit characters indicates
 * scientific notation.  Example: "0.###E0" formats the number 1234 as
 * "1.234E3".
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The number of digit characters after the exponent character gives the
 * minimum exponent digit count.  There is no maximum.  Negative exponents are
 * formatted using the localized minus sign, <em>not</em> the prefix and suffix
 * from the pattern.  This allows patterns such as "0.###E0 m/s".  To prefix
 * positive exponents with a localized plus sign, specify '+' between the
 * exponent and the digits: "0.###E+0" will produce formats "1E+1", "1E+0",
 * "1E-1", etc.  (In localized patterns, use the localized plus sign rather than
 * '+'.)
 *
 * <li>The minimum number of integer digits is achieved by adjusting the
 * exponent.  Example: 0.00123 formatted with "00.###E0" yields "12.3E-4".  This
 * only happens if there is no maximum number of integer digits.  If there is a
 * maximum, then the minimum number of integer digits is fixed at one.
 *
 * <li>The maximum number of integer digits, if present, specifies the exponent
 * grouping.  The most common use of this is to generate <em>engineering
 * notation</em>, in which the exponent is a multiple of three, e.g.,
 * "##0.###E0".  The number 12345 is formatted using "##0.####E0" as "12.345E3".
 *
 * <li>When using scientific notation, the formatter controls the
 * digit counts using significant digits logic.  The maximum number of
 * significant digits limits the total number of integer and fraction
 * digits that will be shown in the mantissa; it does not affect
 * parsing.  For example, 12345 formatted with "##0.##E0" is "12.3E3".
 * See the section on significant digits for more details.
 *
 * <li>The number of significant digits shown is determined as
 * follows: If areSignificantDigitsUsed() returns false, then the
 * minimum number of significant digits shown is one, and the maximum
 * number of significant digits shown is the sum of the <em>minimum
 * integer</em> and <em>maximum fraction</em> digits, and is
 * unaffected by the maximum integer digits.  If this sum is zero,
 * then all significant digits are shown.  If
 * areSignificantDigitsUsed() returns true, then the significant digit
 * counts are specified by getMinimumSignificantDigits() and
 * getMaximumSignificantDigits().  In this case, the number of
 * integer digits is fixed at one, and there is no exponent grouping.
 *
 * <li>Exponential patterns may not contain grouping separators.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <a name="sigdig"><strong>Significant Digits</strong></a>
 *
 * <code>DecimalFormat</code> has two ways of controlling how many
 * digits are shows: (a) significant digits counts, or (b) integer and
 * fraction digit counts.  Integer and fraction digit counts are
 * described above.  When a formatter is using significant digits
 * counts, the number of integer and fraction digits is not specified
 * directly, and the formatter settings for these counts are ignored.
 * Instead, the formatter uses however many integer and fraction
 * digits are required to display the specified number of significant
 * digits.  Examples:
 *
 * <table border=0 cellspacing=3 cellpadding=0>
 *   <tr bgcolor="#ccccff">
 *     <td align=left>Pattern

 * </table>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Significant digit counts may be expressed using patterns that
 * specify a minimum and maximum number of significant digits.  These
 * are indicated by the <code>'@'</code> and <code>'#'</code>
 * characters.  The minimum number of significant digits is the number
 * of <code>'@'</code> characters.  The maximum number of significant
 * digits is the number of <code>'@'</code> characters plus the number
 * of <code>'#'</code> characters following on the right.  For
 * example, the pattern <code>"@@@"</code> indicates exactly 3
 * significant digits.  The pattern <code>"@##"</code> indicates from
 * 1 to 3 significant digits.  Trailing zero digits to the right of
 * the decimal separator are suppressed after the minimum number of
 * significant digits have been shown.  For example, the pattern
 * <code>"@##"</code> formats the number 0.1203 as
 * <code>"0.12"</code>.
 *
 * <li>If a pattern uses significant digits, it may not contain a
 * decimal separator, nor the <code>'0'</code> pattern character.
 * Patterns such as <code>"@00"</code> or <code>"@.###"</code> are
 * disallowed.
 *
 * <li>Any number of <code>'#'</code> characters may be prepended to
 * the left of the leftmost <code>'@'</code> character.  These have no
 * effect on the minimum and maximum significant digits counts, but
 * may be used to position grouping separators.  For example,
 * <code>"#,#@#"</code> indicates a minimum of one significant digits,
 * a maximum of two significant digits, and a grouping size of three.
 *
 * <li>In order to enable significant digits formatting, use a pattern
 * containing the <code>'@'</code> pattern character.  Alternatively,
 * call setSignificantDigitsUsed(TRUE).
 *
 * <li>In order to disable significant digits formatting, use a
 * pattern that does not contain the <code>'@'</code> pattern
 * character. Alternatively, call setSignificantDigitsUsed(FALSE).
 *
 * <li>The number of significant digits has no effect on parsing.
 *
 * <li>Significant digits may be used together with exponential notation. Such
 * patterns are equivalent to a normal exponential pattern with a minimum and
 * maximum integer digit count of one, a minimum fraction digit count of
 * <code>getMinimumSignificantDigits() - 1</code>, and a maximum fraction digit
 * count of <code>getMaximumSignificantDigits() - 1</code>. For example, the
 * pattern <code>"@@###E0"</code> is equivalent to <code>"0.0###E0"</code>.
 *
 * <li>If significant digits are in use, then the integer and fraction
 * digit counts, as set via the API, are ignored.  If significant
 * digits are not in use, then the significant digit counts, as set via
 * the API, are ignored.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Padding</strong>
 *
 * <p>DecimalFormat supports padding the result of
 * format() to a specific width.  Padding may be specified either
 * through the API or through the pattern syntax.  In a pattern the pad escape
 * character, followed by a single pad character, causes padding to be parsed
 * and formatted.  The pad escape character is '*' in unlocalized patterns, and
 * can be localized using DecimalFormatSymbols::setSymbol() with a
 * DecimalFormatSymbols::kPadEscapeSymbol
 * selector.  For example, <code>"$*x#,##0.00"</code> formats 123 to
 * <code>"$xx123.00"</code>, and 1234 to <code>"$1,234.00"</code>.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>When padding is in effect, the width of the positive subpattern,
 * including prefix and suffix, determines the format width.  For example, in
 * the pattern <code>"* #0 o''clock"</code>, the format width is 10.
 *
 * <li>The width is counted in 16-bit code units (char16_ts).
 *
 * <li>Some parameters which usually do not matter have meaning when padding is
 * used, because the pattern width is significant with padding.  In the pattern
 * "* ##,##,#,##0.##", the format width is 14.  The initial characters "##,##,"
 * do not affect the grouping size or maximum integer digits, but they do affect
 * the format width.
 *
 * <li>Padding may be inserted at one of four locations: before the prefix,
 * after the prefix, before the suffix, or after the suffix.  If padding is
 * specified in any other location, applyPattern()
 * sets a failing UErrorCode.  If there is no prefix,
 * before the prefix and after the prefix are equivalent, likewise for the
 * suffix.
 *
 * <li>When specified in a pattern, the 32-bit code point immediately
 * following the pad escape is the pad character. This may be any character,
 * including a special pattern character. That is, the pad escape
 * <em>escapes</em> the following character. If there is no character after
 * the pad escape, then the pattern is illegal.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Rounding</strong>
 *
 * <p>DecimalFormat supports rounding to a specific increment.  For
 * example, 1230 rounded to the nearest 50 is 1250.  1.234 rounded to the
 * nearest 0.65 is 1.3.  The rounding increment may be specified through the API
 * or in a pattern.  To specify a rounding increment in a pattern, include the
 * increment in the pattern itself.  "#,#50" specifies a rounding increment of
 * 50.  "#,##0.05" specifies a rounding increment of 0.05.
 *
 * <p>In the absence of an explicit rounding increment numbers are
 * rounded to their formatted width.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Rounding only affects the string produced by formatting.  It does
 * not affect parsing or change any numerical values.
 *
 * <li>A <em>rounding mode</em> determines how values are rounded; see
 * DecimalFormat::ERoundingMode.  The default rounding mode is
 * DecimalFormat::kRoundHalfEven.  The rounding mode can only be set
 * through the API; it can not be set with a pattern.
 *
 * <li>Some locales use rounding in their currency formats to reflect the
 * smallest currency denomination.
 *
 * <li>In a pattern, digits '1' through '9' specify rounding, but otherwise
 * behave identically to digit '0'.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Synchronization</strong>
 *
 * <p>DecimalFormat objects are not synchronized.  Multiple
 * threads should not access one formatter concurrently.
 *
 * <p><strong>Subclassing</strong>
 *
 * <p><em>User subclasses are not supported.</em> While clients may write
 * subclasses, such code will not necessarily work and will not be
 * guaranteed to work stably from release to release.
