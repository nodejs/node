/**
 * \file
 * \brief C API: UCollationElements
 *
 * The UCollationElements API is used as an iterator to walk through each 
 * character of an international string. Use the iterator to return the
 * ordering priority of the positioned character. The ordering priority of a 
 * character, which we refer to as a key, defines how a character is collated 
 * in the given collation object.
 * For example, consider the following in Slovak and in traditional Spanish collation:
 * <pre>
 * .       "ca" -> the first key is key('c') and second key is key('a').
 * .       "cha" -> the first key is key('ch') and second key is key('a').
 * </pre>
 * And in German phonebook collation,
 * <pre>
 * .       "<ae ligature>b"-> the first key is key('a'), the second key is key('e'), and
 * .       the third key is key('b').
 * </pre>
 * <p>Example of the iterator usage: (without error checking)
 * <pre>
 * .  void CollationElementIterator_Example()
 * .  {
 * .      UChar *s;
 * .      t_int32 order, primaryOrder;
 * .      UCollationElements *c;
 * .      UCollatorOld *coll;
 * .      UErrorCode success = U_ZERO_ERROR;
 * .      str=(UChar*)malloc(sizeof(UChar) * (strlen("This is a test")+1) );
 * .      u_uastrcpy(str, "This is a test");
 * .      coll = ucol_open(NULL, &success);
 * .      c = ucol_openElements(coll, str, u_strlen(str), &status);
 * .      order = ucol_next(c, &success);
 * .      ucol_reset(c);
 * .      order = ucol_prev(c, &success);
 * .      free(str);
 * .      ucol_close(coll);
 * .      ucol_closeElements(c);
 * .  }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * ucol_next() returns the collation order of the next.
 * ucol_prev() returns the collation order of the previous character.
 * The Collation Element Iterator moves only in one direction between calls to
 * ucol_reset. That is, ucol_next() and ucol_prev can not be inter-used. 
 * Whenever ucol_prev is to be called after ucol_next() or vice versa, 
 * ucol_reset has to be called first to reset the status, shifting pointers to 
 * either the end or the start of the string. Hence at the next call of 
 * ucol_prev or ucol_next, the first or last collation order will be returned. 
 * If a change of direction is done without a ucol_reset, the result is 
 * undefined.
 * The result of a forward iterate (ucol_next) and reversed result of the  
 * backward iterate (ucol_prev) on the same string are equivalent, if 
 * collation orders with the value 0 are ignored.
 * Character based on the comparison level of the collator.  A collation order 
 * consists of primary order, secondary order and tertiary order.  The data 
 * type of the collation order is <strong>int32_t</strong>.
