/**
 * \file 
 * \brief C API: Charset Detection API
 *
 * This API provides a facility for detecting the
 * charset or encoding of character data in an unknown text format.
 * The input data can be from an array of bytes.
 * <p>
 * Character set detection is at best an imprecise operation.  The detection
 * process will attempt to identify the charset that best matches the characteristics
 * of the byte data, but the process is partly statistical in nature, and
 * the results can not be guaranteed to always be correct.
 * <p>
 * For best accuracy in charset detection, the input data should be primarily
 * in a single language, and a minimum of a few hundred bytes worth of plain text
 * in the language are needed.  The detection process will attempt to
 * ignore html or xml style markup that could otherwise obscure the content.
