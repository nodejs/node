/**
 *
 * <code>Transliterator</code> is an abstract class that
 * transliterates text from one format to another.  The most common
 * kind of transliterator is a script, or alphabet, transliterator.
 * For example, a Russian to Latin transliterator changes Russian text
 * written in Cyrillic characters to phonetically equivalent Latin
 * characters.  It does not <em>translate</em> Russian to English!
 * Transliteration, unlike translation, operates on characters, without
 * reference to the meanings of words and sentences.
 *
 * <p>Although script conversion is its most common use, a
 * transliterator can actually perform a more general class of tasks.
 * In fact, <code>Transliterator</code> defines a very general API
 * which specifies only that a segment of the input text is replaced
 * by new text.  The particulars of this conversion are determined
 * entirely by subclasses of <code>Transliterator</code>.
 *
 * <p><b>Transliterators are stateless</b>
 *
 * <p><code>Transliterator</code> objects are <em>stateless</em>; they
 * retain no information between calls to
 * <code>transliterate()</code>.  (However, this does <em>not</em>
 * mean that threads may share transliterators without synchronizing
 * them.  Transliterators are not immutable, so they must be
 * synchronized when shared between threads.)  This might seem to
 * limit the complexity of the transliteration operation.  In
 * practice, subclasses perform complex transliterations by delaying
 * the replacement of text until it is known that no other
 * replacements are possible.  In other words, although the
 * <code>Transliterator</code> objects are stateless, the source text
 * itself embodies all the needed information, and delayed operation
 * allows arbitrary complexity.
 *
 * <p><b>Batch transliteration</b>
 *
 * <p>The simplest way to perform transliteration is all at once, on a
 * string of existing text.  This is referred to as <em>batch</em>
 * transliteration.  For example, given a string <code>input</code>
 * and a transliterator <code>t</code>, the call
 *
 *     String result = t.transliterate(input);
 *
 * will transliterate it and return the result.  Other methods allow
 * the client to specify a substring to be transliterated and to use
 * {@link Replaceable } objects instead of strings, in order to
 * preserve out-of-band information (such as text styles).
 *
 * <p><b>Keyboard transliteration</b>
 *
 * <p>Somewhat more involved is <em>keyboard</em>, or incremental
 * transliteration.  This is the transliteration of text that is
 * arriving from some source (typically the user's keyboard) one
 * character at a time, or in some other piecemeal fashion.
 *
 * <p>In keyboard transliteration, a <code>Replaceable</code> buffer
 * stores the text.  As text is inserted, as much as possible is
 * transliterated on the fly.  This means a GUI that displays the
 * contents of the buffer may show text being modified as each new
 * character arrives.
 *
 * <p>Consider the simple rule-based Transliterator:
 * <pre>
 *     th>{theta}
 *     t>{tau}
 * </pre>
 *
 * When the user types 't', nothing will happen, since the
 * transliterator is waiting to see if the next character is 'h'.  To
 * remedy this, we introduce the notion of a cursor, marked by a '|'
 * in the output string:
 * <pre>
 *     t>|{tau}
 *     {tau}h>{theta}
 * </pre>
 *
 * Now when the user types 't', tau appears, and if the next character
 * is 'h', the tau changes to a theta.  This is accomplished by
 * maintaining a cursor position (independent of the insertion point,
 * and invisible in the GUI) across calls to
 * <code>transliterate()</code>.  Typically, the cursor will
 * be coincident with the insertion point, but in a case like the one
 * above, it will precede the insertion point.
 *
 * <p>Keyboard transliteration methods maintain a set of three indices
 * that are updated with each call to
 * <code>transliterate()</code>, including the cursor, start,
 * and limit.  Since these indices are changed by the method, they are
 * passed in an <code>int[]</code> array. The <code>START</code> index
 * marks the beginning of the substring that the transliterator will
 * look at.  It is advanced as text becomes committed (but it is not
 * the committed index; that's the <code>CURSOR</code>).  The
 * <code>CURSOR</code> index, described above, marks the point at
 * which the transliterator last stopped, either because it reached
 * the end, or because it required more characters to disambiguate
 * between possible inputs.  The <code>CURSOR</code> can also be
 * explicitly set by rules in a rule-based Transliterator.
 * Any characters before the <code>CURSOR</code> index are frozen;
 * future keyboard transliteration calls within this input sequence
 * will not change them.  New text is inserted at the
 * <code>LIMIT</code> index, which marks the end of the substring that
 * the transliterator looks at.
 *
 * <p>Because keyboard transliteration assumes that more characters
 * are to arrive, it is conservative in its operation.  It only
 * transliterates when it can do so unambiguously.  Otherwise it waits
 * for more characters to arrive.  When the client code knows that no
 * more characters are forthcoming, perhaps because the user has
 * performed some input termination operation, then it should call
 * <code>finishTransliteration()</code> to complete any
 * pending transliterations.
 *
 * <p><b>Inverses</b>
 *
 * <p>Pairs of transliterators may be inverses of one another.  For
 * example, if transliterator <b>A</b> transliterates characters by
 * incrementing their Unicode value (so "abc" -> "def"), and
 * transliterator <b>B</b> decrements character values, then <b>A</b>
 * is an inverse of <b>B</b> and vice versa.  If we compose <b>A</b>
 * with <b>B</b> in a compound transliterator, the result is the
 * indentity transliterator, that is, a transliterator that does not
 * change its input text.
 *
 * The <code>Transliterator</code> method <code>getInverse()</code>
 * returns a transliterator's inverse, if one exists, or
 * <code>null</code> otherwise.  However, the result of
 * <code>getInverse()</code> usually will <em>not</em> be a true
 * mathematical inverse.  This is because true inverse transliterators
 * are difficult to formulate.  For example, consider two
 * transliterators: <b>AB</b>, which transliterates the character 'A'
 * to 'B', and <b>BA</b>, which transliterates 'B' to 'A'.  It might
 * seem that these are exact inverses, since
 *
 * \htmlonly<blockquote>\endhtmlonly"A" x <b>AB</b> -> "B"<br>
 * "B" x <b>BA</b> -> "A"\htmlonly</blockquote>\endhtmlonly
 *
 * where 'x' represents transliteration.  However,
 *
 * \htmlonly<blockquote>\endhtmlonly"ABCD" x <b>AB</b> -> "BBCD"<br>
 * "BBCD" x <b>BA</b> -> "AACD"\htmlonly</blockquote>\endhtmlonly
 *
 * so <b>AB</b> composed with <b>BA</b> is not the
 * identity. Nonetheless, <b>BA</b> may be usefully considered to be
 * <b>AB</b>'s inverse, and it is on this basis that
 * <b>AB</b><code>.getInverse()</code> could legitimately return
 * <b>BA</b>.
 *
 * <p><b>IDs and display names</b>
 *
 * <p>A transliterator is designated by a short identifier string or
 * <em>ID</em>.  IDs follow the format <em>source-destination</em>,
 * where <em>source</em> describes the entity being replaced, and
 * <em>destination</em> describes the entity replacing
 * <em>source</em>.  The entities may be the names of scripts,
 * particular sequences of characters, or whatever else it is that the
 * transliterator converts to or from.  For example, a transliterator
 * from Russian to Latin might be named "Russian-Latin".  A
 * transliterator from keyboard escape sequences to Latin-1 characters
 * might be named "KeyboardEscape-Latin1".  By convention, system
 * entity names are in English, with the initial letters of words
 * capitalized; user entity names may follow any format so long as
 * they do not contain dashes.
 *
 * <p>In addition to programmatic IDs, transliterator objects have
 * display names for presentation in user interfaces, returned by
 * {@link #getDisplayName }.
 *
 * <p><b>Factory methods and registration</b>
 *
 * <p>In general, client code should use the factory method
 * {@link #createInstance } to obtain an instance of a
 * transliterator given its ID.  Valid IDs may be enumerated using
 * <code>getAvailableIDs()</code>.  Since transliterators are mutable,
 * multiple calls to {@link #createInstance } with the same ID will
 * return distinct objects.
 *
 * <p>In addition to the system transliterators registered at startup,
 * user transliterators may be registered by calling
 * <code>registerInstance()</code> at run time.  A registered instance
 * acts a template; future calls to {@link #createInstance } with the ID
 * of the registered object return clones of that object.  Thus any
 * object passed to <tt>registerInstance()</tt> must implement
 * <tt>clone()</tt> propertly.  To register a transliterator subclass
 * without instantiating it (until it is needed), users may call
 * {@link #registerFactory }.  In this case, the objects are
 * instantiated by invoking the zero-argument public constructor of
 * the class.
 *
 * <p><b>Subclassing</b>
 *
 * Subclasses must implement the abstract method
 * <code>handleTransliterate()</code>.  <p>Subclasses should override
 * the <code>transliterate()</code> method taking a
 * <code>Replaceable</code> and the <code>transliterate()</code>
 * method taking a <code>String</code> and <code>StringBuffer</code>
 * if the performance of these methods can be improved over the
 * performance obtained by the default implementations in this class.
 *
 * <p><b>Rule syntax</b>
 *
 * <p>A set of rules determines how to perform translations.
 * Rules within a rule set are separated by semicolons (';').
 * To include a literal semicolon, prefix it with a backslash ('\').
 * Unicode Pattern_White_Space is ignored.
 * If the first non-blank character on a line is '#',
 * the entire line is ignored as a comment.
 *
 * <p>Each set of rules consists of two groups, one forward, and one
 * reverse. This is a convention that is not enforced; rules for one
 * direction may be omitted, with the result that translations in
 * that direction will not modify the source text. In addition,
 * bidirectional forward-reverse rules may be specified for
 * symmetrical transformations.
 *
 * <p>Note: Another description of the Transliterator rule syntax is available in
 * <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-general.html#Transform_Rules_Syntax">section
 * Transform Rules Syntax of UTS #35: Unicode LDML</a>.
 * The rules are shown there using arrow symbols ← and → and ↔.
 * ICU supports both those and the equivalent ASCII symbols &lt; and &gt; and &lt;&gt;.
 *
 * <p>Rule statements take one of the following forms:
 *
 * <dl>
 *     <dt><code>$alefmadda=\\u0622;</code></dt>
 *     <dd><strong>Variable definition.</strong> The name on the
 *         left is assigned the text on the right. In this example,
 *         after this statement, instances of the left hand name,
 *         &quot;<code>$alefmadda</code>&quot;, will be replaced by
 *         the Unicode character U+0622. Variable names must begin
 *         with a letter and consist only of letters, digits, and
 *         underscores. Case is significant. Duplicate names cause
 *         an exception to be thrown, that is, variables cannot be
 *         redefined. The right hand side may contain well-formed
 *         text of any length, including no text at all (&quot;<code>$empty=;</code>&quot;).
 *         The right hand side may contain embedded <code>UnicodeSet</code>
 *         patterns, for example, &quot;<code>$softvowel=[eiyEIY]</code>&quot;.</dd>
 *     <dt><code>ai&gt;$alefmadda;</code></dt>
 *     <dd><strong>Forward translation rule.</strong> This rule
 *         states that the string on the left will be changed to the
 *         string on the right when performing forward
 *         transliteration.</dd>
 *     <dt><code>ai&lt;$alefmadda;</code></dt>
 *     <dd><strong>Reverse translation rule.</strong> This rule
 *         states that the string on the right will be changed to
 *         the string on the left when performing reverse
 *         transliteration.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <dl>
 *     <dt><code>ai&lt;&gt;$alefmadda;</code></dt>
 *     <dd><strong>Bidirectional translation rule.</strong> This
 *         rule states that the string on the right will be changed
 *         to the string on the left when performing forward
 *         transliteration, and vice versa when performing reverse
 *         transliteration.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <p>Translation rules consist of a <em>match pattern</em> and an <em>output
 * string</em>. The match pattern consists of literal characters,
 * optionally preceded by context, and optionally followed by
 * context. Context characters, like literal pattern characters,
 * must be matched in the text being transliterated. However, unlike
 * literal pattern characters, they are not replaced by the output
 * text. For example, the pattern &quot;<code>abc{def}</code>&quot;
 * indicates the characters &quot;<code>def</code>&quot; must be
 * preceded by &quot;<code>abc</code>&quot; for a successful match.
 * If there is a successful match, &quot;<code>def</code>&quot; will
 * be replaced, but not &quot;<code>abc</code>&quot;. The final '<code>}</code>'
 * is optional, so &quot;<code>abc{def</code>&quot; is equivalent to
 * &quot;<code>abc{def}</code>&quot;. Another example is &quot;<code>{123}456</code>&quot;
 * (or &quot;<code>123}456</code>&quot;) in which the literal
 * pattern &quot;<code>123</code>&quot; must be followed by &quot;<code>456</code>&quot;.
 *
 * <p>The output string of a forward or reverse rule consists of
 * characters to replace the literal pattern characters. If the
 * output string contains the character '<code>|</code>', this is
 * taken to indicate the location of the <em>cursor</em> after
 * replacement. The cursor is the point in the text at which the
 * next replacement, if any, will be applied. The cursor is usually
 * placed within the replacement text; however, it can actually be
 * placed into the precending or following context by using the
 * special character '@'. Examples:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     a {foo} z &gt; | @ bar; # foo -&gt; bar, move cursor before a
 *     {foo} xyz &gt; bar @@|; #&nbsp;foo -&gt; bar, cursor between y and z
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>UnicodeSet</b>
 *
 * <p><code>UnicodeSet</code> patterns may appear anywhere that
 * makes sense. They may appear in variable definitions.
 * Contrariwise, <code>UnicodeSet</code> patterns may themselves
 * contain variable references, such as &quot;<code>$a=[a-z];$not_a=[^$a]</code>&quot;,
 * or &quot;<code>$range=a-z;$ll=[$range]</code>&quot;.
 *
 * <p><code>UnicodeSet</code> patterns may also be embedded directly
 * into rule strings. Thus, the following two rules are equivalent:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     $vowel=[aeiou]; $vowel&gt;'*'; # One way to do this
 *     [aeiou]&gt;'*'; # Another way
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>See {@link UnicodeSet} for more documentation and examples.
 *
 * <p><b>Segments</b>
 *
 * <p>Segments of the input string can be matched and copied to the
 * output string. This makes certain sets of rules simpler and more
 * general, and makes reordering possible. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     ([a-z]) &gt; $1 $1; # double lowercase letters
 *     ([:Lu:]) ([:Ll:]) &gt; $2 $1; # reverse order of Lu-Ll pairs
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The segment of the input string to be copied is delimited by
 * &quot;<code>(</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>)</code>&quot;. Up to
 * nine segments may be defined. Segments may not overlap. In the
 * output string, &quot;<code>$1</code>&quot; through &quot;<code>$9</code>&quot;
 * represent the input string segments, in left-to-right order of
 * definition.
 *
 * <p><b>Anchors</b>
 *
 * <p>Patterns can be anchored to the beginning or the end of the text. This is done with the
 * special characters '<code>^</code>' and '<code>$</code>'. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   ^ a&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 'BEG_A'; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match 'a' at start of text
 *   &nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 'A'; # match other instances of 'a'
 *   &nbsp; z $ &gt; 'END_Z'; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match 'z' at end of text
 *   &nbsp; z&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 'Z';&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # match other instances of 'z'
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>It is also possible to match the beginning or the end of the text using a <code>UnicodeSet</code>.
 * This is done by including a virtual anchor character '<code>$</code>' at the end of the
 * set pattern. Although this is usually the match chafacter for the end anchor, the set will
 * match either the beginning or the end of the text, depending on its placement. For
 * example:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   $x = [a-z$]; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match 'a' through 'z' OR anchor
 *   $x 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; 2;&nbsp;&nbsp; # match '1' after a-z or at the start
 *   &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 $x &gt; 4; &nbsp;&nbsp;# match '3' before a-z or at the end
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b>
 *
 * <p>The following example rules illustrate many of the features of
 * the rule language.
 *
 * <table border="0" cellpadding="4">
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rule 1.</td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>abc{def}&gt;x|y</code></td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rule 2.</td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>xyz&gt;r</code></td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rule 3.</td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>yz&gt;q</code></td>
 *     </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>Applying these rules to the string &quot;<code>adefabcdefz</code>&quot;
 * yields the following results:
 *
 * <table border="0" cellpadding="4">
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>|adefabcdefz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Initial state, no rules match. Advance
 *         cursor.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>a|defabcdefz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Still no match. Rule 1 does not match
 *         because the preceding context is not present.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>ad|efabcdefz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Still no match. Keep advancing until
 *         there is a match...</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>ade|fabcdefz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">...</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adef|abcdefz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">...</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adefa|bcdefz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">...</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adefab|cdefz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">...</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adefabc|defz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Rule 1 matches; replace &quot;<code>def</code>&quot;
 *         with &quot;<code>xy</code>&quot; and back up the cursor
 *         to before the '<code>y</code>'.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adefabcx|yz</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">Although &quot;<code>xyz</code>&quot; is
 *         present, rule 2 does not match because the cursor is
 *         before the '<code>y</code>', not before the '<code>x</code>'.
 *         Rule 3 does match. Replace &quot;<code>yz</code>&quot;
 *         with &quot;<code>q</code>&quot;.</td>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top; write-space: nowrap;"><code>adefabcxq|</code></td>
 *         <td style="vertical-align: top;">The cursor is at the end;
 *         transliteration is complete.</td>
 *     </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>The order of rules is significant. If multiple rules may match
 * at some point, the first matching rule is applied.
 *
 * <p>Forward and reverse rules may have an empty output string.
 * Otherwise, an empty left or right hand side of any statement is a
 * syntax error.
 *
 * <p>Single quotes are used to quote any character other than a
 * digit or letter. To specify a single quote itself, inside or
 * outside of quotes, use two single quotes in a row. For example,
 * the rule &quot;<code>'&gt;'&gt;o''clock</code>&quot; changes the
 * string &quot;<code>&gt;</code>&quot; to the string &quot;<code>o'clock</code>&quot;.
 *
 * <p><b>Notes</b>
 *
 * <p>While a Transliterator is being built from rules, it checks that
 * the rules are added in proper order. For example, if the rule
 * &quot;a&gt;x&quot; is followed by the rule &quot;ab&gt;y&quot;,
 * then the second rule will throw an exception. The reason is that
 * the second rule can never be triggered, since the first rule
 * always matches anything it matches. In other words, the first
 * rule <em>masks</em> the second rule.
