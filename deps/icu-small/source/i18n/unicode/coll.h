/**
* The <code>Collator</code> class performs locale-sensitive string
* comparison.<br>
* You use this class to build searching and sorting routines for natural
* language text.
* <p>
* <code>Collator</code> is an abstract base class. Subclasses implement
* specific collation strategies. One subclass,
* <code>RuleBasedCollator</code>, is currently provided and is applicable
* to a wide set of languages. Other subclasses may be created to handle more
* specialized needs.
* <p>
* Like other locale-sensitive classes, you can use the static factory method,
* <code>createInstance</code>, to obtain the appropriate
* <code>Collator</code> object for a given locale. You will only need to
* look at the subclasses of <code>Collator</code> if you need to
* understand the details of a particular collation strategy or if you need to
* modify that strategy.
* <p>
* The following example shows how to compare two strings using the
* <code>Collator</code> for the default locale.
* \htmlonly<blockquote>\endhtmlonly
* <pre>
* \code
* // Compare two strings in the default locale
* UErrorCode success = U_ZERO_ERROR;
* Collator* myCollator = Collator::createInstance(success);
* if (myCollator->compare("abc", "ABC") < 0)
*   cout << "abc is less than ABC" << endl;
* else
*   cout << "abc is greater than or equal to ABC" << endl;
* \endcode
* </pre>
* \htmlonly</blockquote>\endhtmlonly
* <p>
* You can set a <code>Collator</code>'s <em>strength</em> attribute to
* determine the level of difference considered significant in comparisons.
* Five strengths are provided: <code>PRIMARY</code>, <code>SECONDARY</code>,
* <code>TERTIARY</code>, <code>QUATERNARY</code> and <code>IDENTICAL</code>.
* The exact assignment of strengths to language features is locale dependent.
* For example, in Czech, "e" and "f" are considered primary differences,
* while "e" and "\u00EA" are secondary differences, "e" and "E" are tertiary
* differences and "e" and "e" are identical. The following shows how both case
* and accents could be ignored for US English.
* \htmlonly<blockquote>\endhtmlonly
* <pre>
* \code
* //Get the Collator for US English and set its strength to PRIMARY
* UErrorCode success = U_ZERO_ERROR;
* Collator* usCollator = Collator::createInstance(Locale::getUS(), success);
* usCollator->setStrength(Collator::PRIMARY);
* if (usCollator->compare("abc", "ABC") == 0)
*     cout << "'abc' and 'ABC' strings are equivalent with strength PRIMARY" << endl;
* \endcode
* </pre>
* \htmlonly</blockquote>\endhtmlonly
*
* The <code>getSortKey</code> methods
* convert a string to a series of bytes that can be compared bitwise against
* other sort keys using <code>strcmp()</code>. Sort keys are written as
* zero-terminated byte strings.
*
* Another set of APIs returns a <code>CollationKey</code> object that wraps
* the sort key bytes instead of returning the bytes themselves.
* </p>
* <p>
* <strong>Note:</strong> <code>Collator</code>s with different Locale,
* and CollationStrength settings will return different sort
* orders for the same set of strings. Locales have specific collation rules,
* and the way in which secondary and tertiary differences are taken into
* account, for example, will result in a different sorting order for same
* strings.
* </p>
