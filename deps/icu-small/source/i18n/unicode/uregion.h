/**

 * \brief C API: URegion (territory containment and mapping)
 *
 * URegion objects represent data associated with a particular Unicode Region Code, also known as a
 * Unicode Region Subtag, which is defined based upon the BCP 47 standard. These include:
 * * Two-letter codes defined by ISO 3166-1, with special LDML treatment of certain private-use or
 *   reserved codes;
 * * A subset of 3-digit numeric codes defined by UN M.49.
 * URegion objects can also provide mappings to and from additional codes. There are different types
 * of regions that are important to distinguish:
 * <p>
 * Macroregion - A code for a "macro geographical (continental) region, geographical sub-region, or
 * selected economic and other grouping" as defined in UN M.49. These are typically 3-digit codes,
 * but contain some 2-letter codes for LDML extensions, such as "QO" for Outlying Oceania.
 * Macroregions are represented in ICU by one of three region types: WORLD (code 001),
 * CONTINENTS (regions contained directly by WORLD), and SUBCONTINENTS (regions contained directly
 * by a continent ).
 * <p>
 * TERRITORY - A Region that is not a Macroregion. These are typically codes for countries, but also
 * include areas that are not separate countries, such as the code "AQ" for Antarctica or the code
 * "HK" for Hong Kong (SAR China). Overseas dependencies of countries may or may not have separate
 * codes. The codes are typically 2-letter codes aligned with ISO 3166, but BCP47 allows for the use
 * of 3-digit codes in the future.
 * <p>
 * UNKNOWN - The code ZZ is defined by Unicode LDML for use in indicating that region is unknown,
 * or that the value supplied as a region was invalid.
 * <p>
 * DEPRECATED - Region codes that have been defined in the past but are no longer in modern usage,
 * usually due to a country splitting into multiple territories or changing its name.
 * <p>
 * GROUPING - A widely understood grouping of territories that has a well defined membership such
 * that a region code has been assigned for it.  Some of these are UN M.49 codes that don't fall into
 * the world/continent/sub-continent hierarchy, while others are just well-known groupings that have
 * their own region code. Region "EU" (European Union) is one such region code that is a grouping.
 * Groupings will never be returned by the uregion_getContainingRegion, since a different type of region
 * (WORLD, CONTINENT, or SUBCONTINENT) will always be the containing region instead.
 *
 * URegion objects are const/immutable, owned and maintained by ICU itself, so there are not functions
 * to open or close them.
