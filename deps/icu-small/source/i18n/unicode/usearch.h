 * \file
 * \brief C API: StringSearch
 *
 * C APIs for an engine that provides language-sensitive text searching based 
 * on the comparison rules defined in a <tt>UCollator</tt> data struct,
 * see <tt>ucol.h</tt>. This ensures that language eccentricity can be 
 * handled, e.g. for the German collator, characters &szlig; and SS will be matched 
 * if case is chosen to be ignored. 
 * See the <a href="http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icuhtml/trunk/design/collation/ICU_collation_design.htm">
 * "ICU Collation Design Document"</a> for more information.
 * <p> 
 * The implementation may use a linear search or a modified form of the Boyer-Moore
 * search; for more information on the latter see 
 * <a href="http://icu-project.org/docs/papers/efficient_text_searching_in_java.html">
 * "Efficient Text Searching in Java"</a>, published in <i>Java Report</i> 
 * in February, 1999.
 * <p>
 * There are 2 match options for selection:<br>
 * Let S' be the sub-string of a text string S between the offsets start and 
 * end <start, end>.
 * <br>
 * A pattern string P matches a text string S at the offsets <start, end> 
 * if
 * <pre> 
 * option 1. Some canonical equivalent of P matches some canonical equivalent 
 *           of S'
 * option 2. P matches S' and if P starts or ends with a combining mark, 
 *           there exists no non-ignorable combining mark before or after S' 
 *           in S respectively. 
 * </pre>
 * Option 2. will be the default.
 * <p>
 * This search has APIs similar to that of other text iteration mechanisms 
 * such as the break iterators in <tt>ubrk.h</tt>. Using these 
 * APIs, it is easy to scan through text looking for all occurrences of 
 * a given pattern. This search iterator allows changing of direction by 
 * calling a <tt>reset</tt> followed by a <tt>next</tt> or <tt>previous</tt>. 
 * Though a direction change can occur without calling <tt>reset</tt> first,  
 * this operation comes with some speed penalty.
 * Generally, match results in the forward direction will match the result 
 * matches in the backwards direction in the reverse order
 * <p>
 * <tt>usearch.h</tt> provides APIs to specify the starting position 
 * within the text string to be searched, e.g. <tt>usearch_setOffset</tt>,
 * <tt>usearch_preceding</tt> and <tt>usearch_following</tt>. Since the 
 * starting position will be set as it is specified, please take note that 
 * there are some dangerous positions which the search may render incorrect 
 * results:
 * <ul>
 * <li> The midst of a substring that requires normalization.
 * <li> If the following match is to be found, the position should not be the
 *      second character which requires to be swapped with the preceding 
 *      character. Vice versa, if the preceding match is to be found, 
 *      position to search from should not be the first character which 
 *      requires to be swapped with the next character. E.g certain Thai and
 *      Lao characters require swapping.
 * <li> If a following pattern match is to be found, any position within a 
 *      contracting sequence except the first will fail. Vice versa if a 
 *      preceding pattern match is to be found, a invalid starting point 
 *      would be any character within a contracting sequence except the last.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A breakiterator can be used if only matches at logical breaks are desired.
 * Using a breakiterator will only give you results that exactly matches the
 * boundaries given by the breakiterator. For instance the pattern "e" will
 * not be found in the string "\u00e9" if a character break iterator is used.
 * <p>
 * Options are provided to handle overlapping matches. 
 * E.g. In English, overlapping matches produces the result 0 and 2 
 * for the pattern "abab" in the text "ababab", where else mutually 
 * exclusive matches only produce the result of 0.
 * <p>
 * Options are also provided to implement "asymmetric search" as described in
 * <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#Asymmetric_Search">
 * UTS #10 Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>, specifically the USearchAttribute
 * USEARCH_ELEMENT_COMPARISON and its values.
 * <p>
 * Though collator attributes will be taken into consideration while 
 * performing matches, there are no APIs here for setting and getting the 
 * attributes. These attributes can be set by getting the collator
 * from <tt>usearch_getCollator</tt> and using the APIs in <tt>ucol.h</tt>.
 * Lastly to update String Search to the new collator attributes, 
 * usearch_reset() has to be called.
 * <p> 
 * Restriction: <br>
 * Currently there are no composite characters that consists of a
 * character with combining class > 0 before a character with combining 
 * class == 0. However, if such a character exists in the future, the 
 * search mechanism does not guarantee the results for option 1.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example of use:<br>
 * <pre><code>
 * char *tgtstr = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy fox";
 * char *patstr = "fox";
 * UChar target[64];
 * UChar pattern[16];
 * UErrorCode status = U_ZERO_ERROR;
 * u_uastrcpy(target, tgtstr);
 * u_uastrcpy(pattern, patstr);
 *
 * UStringSearch *search = usearch_open(pattern, -1, target, -1, "en_US", 
 *                                  NULL, &status);
 * if (U_SUCCESS(status)) {
 *     for (int pos = usearch_first(search, &status); 
 *          pos != USEARCH_DONE; 
 *          pos = usearch_next(search, &status))
 *     {
 *         printf("Found match at %d pos, length is %d\n", pos, 
 *                                        usearch_getMatchedLength(search));
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * usearch_close(search);
