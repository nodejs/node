/**
 * \file
 * \brief C++ API: Regular Expressions
 *
 * The ICU API for processing regular expressions consists of two classes,
 *  `RegexPattern` and `RegexMatcher`.
 *  `RegexPattern` objects represent a pre-processed, or compiled
 *  regular expression.  They are created from a regular expression pattern string,
 *  and can be used to create `RegexMatcher` objects for the pattern.
 *
 * Class `RegexMatcher` bundles together a regular expression
 *  pattern and a target string to which the search pattern will be applied.
 *  `RegexMatcher` includes API for doing plain find or search
 *  operations, for search and replace operations, and for obtaining detailed
 *  information about bounds of a match.
 *
 * Note that by constructing `RegexMatcher` objects directly from regular
 * expression pattern strings application code can be simplified and the explicit
 * need for `RegexPattern` objects can usually be eliminated.
