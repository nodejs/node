   * @param destFields    An array of mutable UText structs to receive the results of the split.
   *                If a field is NULL, a new UText is allocated to contain the results for
   *                that field. This new UText is not guaranteed to be mutable.
   * @param destFieldsCapacity  The number of elements in the destination array.
   *                If the number of fields found is less than destCapacity, the
   *                extra strings in the destination array are not altered.

   *                of fields, the trailing part of the input string, including any
   *                field delimiters, is placed in the last destination string.
   *                This behavior mimics that of Perl.  It is not  an error condition, and no
   *                error status is returned when all destField positions are used.
   * @param status  A reference to a UErrorCode to receive any errors.
   * @return        The number of fields into which the input string was split.
