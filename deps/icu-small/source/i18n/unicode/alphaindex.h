/**
 * AlphabeticIndex supports the creation of a UI index appropriate for a given language.
 * It can support either direct use, or use with a client that doesn't support localized collation.
 * The following is an example of what an index might look like in a UI:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  <b>... A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  ...</b>
 *
 *  <b>A</b>
 *     Addison
 *     Albertson
 *     Azensky
 *  <b>B</b>
 *     Baker
 *  ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * The class can generate a list of labels for use as a UI "index", that is, a list of
 * clickable characters (or character sequences) that allow the user to see a segment
 * (bucket) of a larger "target" list. That is, each label corresponds to a bucket in
 * the target list, where everything in the bucket is greater than or equal to the character
 * (according to the locale's collation). Strings can be added to the index;
 * they will be in sorted order in the right bucket.
 * <p>
 * The class also supports having buckets for strings before the first (underflow),
 * after the last (overflow), and between scripts (inflow). For example, if the index
 * is constructed with labels for Russian and English, Greek characters would fall
 * into an inflow bucket between the other two scripts.
 * <p>
 * The AlphabeticIndex class is not intended for public subclassing.
 *
 * <p><em>Note:</em> If you expect to have a lot of ASCII or Latin characters
 * as well as characters from the user's language,
 * then it is a good idea to call addLabels(Locale::getEnglish(), status).</p>
 *
 * <h2>Direct Use</h2>
 * <p>The following shows an example of building an index directly.
 *  The "show..." methods below are just to illustrate usage.
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Create a simple index.  "Item" is assumed to be an application
 * // defined type that the application's UI and other processing knows about,
 * //  and that has a name.
 *
 * UErrorCode status = U_ZERO_ERROR;
 * AlphabeticIndex index = new AlphabeticIndex(desiredLocale, status);
 * index->addLabels(additionalLocale, status);
 * for (Item *item in some source of Items ) {
 *     index->addRecord(item->name(), item, status);
 * }
 * ...
 * // Show index at top. We could skip or gray out empty buckets
 *
 * while (index->nextBucket(status)) {
 *     if (showAll || index->getBucketRecordCount() != 0) {
 *         showLabelAtTop(UI, index->getBucketLabel());
 *     }
 * }
 *  ...
 * // Show the buckets with their contents, skipping empty buckets
 *
 * index->resetBucketIterator(status);
 * while (index->nextBucket(status)) {
 *    if (index->getBucketRecordCount() != 0) {
 *        showLabelInList(UI, index->getBucketLabel());
 *        while (index->nextRecord(status)) {
 *            showIndexedItem(UI, static_cast<Item *>(index->getRecordData()))
 * </pre>
 *
 * The caller can build different UIs using this class.
 * For example, an index character could be omitted or grayed-out
 * if its bucket is empty. Small buckets could also be combined based on size, such as:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <b>... A-F G-N O-Z ...</b>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Client Support</h2>
 * <p>Callers can also use the AlphabeticIndex::ImmutableIndex, or the AlphabeticIndex itself,
 * to support sorting on a client that doesn't support AlphabeticIndex functionality.
 *
 * <p>The ImmutableIndex is both immutable and thread-safe.
 * The corresponding AlphabeticIndex methods are not thread-safe because
 * they "lazily" build the index buckets.
 * <ul>
 * <li>ImmutableIndex.getBucket(index) provides random access to all
 *     buckets and their labels and label types.
 * <li>The AlphabeticIndex bucket iterator or ImmutableIndex.getBucket(0..getBucketCount-1)
 *     can be used to get a list of the labels,
 *     such as "...", "A", "B",..., and send that list to the client.
 * <li>When the client has a new name, it sends that name to the server.
 * The server needs to call the following methods,
 * and communicate the bucketIndex and collationKey back to the client.
 *
 * <pre>
 * int32_t bucketIndex = index.getBucketIndex(name, status);
 * const UnicodeString &label = immutableIndex.getBucket(bucketIndex)->getLabel();  // optional
 * int32_t skLength = collator.getSortKey(name, sk, skCapacity);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li>The client would put the name (and associated information) into its bucket for bucketIndex. The sort key sk is a
 * sequence of bytes that can be compared with a binary compare, and produce the right localized result.</li>
 * </ul>
