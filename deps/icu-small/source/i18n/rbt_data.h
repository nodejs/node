 * a const pointer to a TRD object that they do not own.  TRD objects
 * are essentially the parsed rules in compact, usable form.  The
 * TRD objects themselves are held for the life of the process in
 * a static cache owned by Transliterator.
 *
 * This class' API is a little asymmetric.  There is a method to
 * define a variable, but no way to define a set.  This is because the
 * sets are defined by the parser in a UVector, and the vector is
 * copied into a fixed-size array here.  Once this is done, no new
 * sets may be defined.  In practice, there is no need to do so, since
 * generating the data and using it are discrete phases.  When there
 * is a need to access the set data during the parse phase, another
 * data structure handles this.  See the parsing code for more
 * details.
