/**
 * A transliterator that converts Unicode characters to an escape
 * form.  Examples of escape forms are "U+4E01" and "&#x10FFFF;".
 * Escape forms have a prefix and suffix, either of which may be
 * empty, a radix, typically 16 or 10, a minimum digit count,
 * typically 1, 4, or 8, and a boolean that specifies whether
 * supplemental characters are handled as 32-bit code points or as two
 * 16-bit code units.  Most escape forms handle 32-bit code points,
 * but some, such as the Java form, intentionally break them into two
 * surrogate pairs, for backward compatibility.
 *
 * <p>Some escape forms actually have two different patterns, one for
 * BMP characters (0..FFFF) and one for supplements (>FFFF).  To
 * handle this, a second EscapeTransliterator may be defined that
 * specifies the pattern to be produced for supplementals.  An example
 * of a form that requires this is the C form, which uses "\\uFFFF"
 * for BMP characters and "\\U0010FFFF" for supplementals.
 *
 * <p>This class is package private.  It registers several standard
 * variants with the system which are then accessed via their IDs.
