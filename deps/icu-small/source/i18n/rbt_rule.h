/**
 * A transliteration rule used by
 * <code>RuleBasedTransliterator</code>.
 * <code>TransliterationRule</code> is an immutable object.
 *
 * <p>A rule consists of an input pattern and an output string.  When
 * the input pattern is matched, the output string is emitted.  The
 * input pattern consists of zero or more characters which are matched
 * exactly (the key) and optional context.  Context must match if it
 * is specified.  Context may be specified before the key, after the
 * key, or both.  The key, preceding context, and following context
 * may contain variables.  Variables represent a set of Unicode
 * characters, such as the letters <i>a</i> through <i>z</i>.
 * Variables are detected by looking up each character in a supplied
 * variable list to see if it has been so defined.
 *
 * <p>A rule may contain segments in its input string and segment
 * references in its output string.  A segment is a substring of the
 * input pattern, indicated by an offset and limit.  The segment may
 * be in the preceding or following context.  It may not span a
 * context boundary.  A segment reference is a special character in
 * the output string that causes a segment of the input string (not
 * the input pattern) to be copied to the output string.  The range of
 * special characters that represent segment references is defined by
 * RuleBasedTransliterator.Data.
