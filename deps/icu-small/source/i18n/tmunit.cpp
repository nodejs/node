UOBJECT_DEFINE_RTTI_IMPLEMENTATION(TimeUnit)


/*
 * There are only 7 time units.
 * So, TimeUnit could be made as singleton 
 * (similar to uniset_props.cpp, or unorm.cpp,
 * in which a static TimeUnit* array is created, and 
 * the creatInstance() returns a const TimeUnit*).
 * But the constraint is TimeUnit is a data member of Measure.
 * But Measure (which is an existing API) does not expect it's "unit" member
 * as singleton. Meaure takes ownership of the "unit" member.
 * In its constructor, it does not take a const "unit" pointer.
 * Also, Measure can clone and destruct the "unit" pointer.
 * In order to preserve the old behavior and let Measure handle singleton "unit",  
 * 1. a flag need to be added in Measure; 
 * 2. a new constructor which takes const "unit" as parameter need to be added,
 *    and this new constructor will set the flag on.
 * 3. clone and destructor need to check upon this flag to distinguish on how
 *    to handle the "unit". 
 * 
 * Since TimeUnit is such a light weight object, comparing with the heavy weight
 * format operation, we decided to avoid the above complication.
 * 
 * So, both TimeUnit and CurrencyUnit (the 2 subclasses of MeasureUnit) are
 * immutable and non-singleton.
 *
 * Currently, TimeUnitAmount and CurrencyAmount are immutable.
 * If an application needs to create a long list of TimeUnitAmount on the same
 * time unit but different number, for example,
 * 1 hour, 2 hour, 3 hour, ................. 10,000 hour,
 * there might be performance hit because 10,000 TimeUnit object, 
 * although all are the same time unit, will be created in heap and deleted.
 *
 * To address this performance issue, if there is any in the future,
 * we should and need to change TimeUnitAmount and CurrencyAmount to be 
 * immutable by allowing a setter on the number.
 * Or we need to add 2 parallel mutable classes in order to 
 * preserve the existing API.
 * Or we can use freezable.
