/* This hashtable is implemented as a double hash.  All elements are
 * stored in a single array with no secondary storage for collision
 * resolution (no linked list, etc.).  When there is a hash collision
 * (when two unequal keys have the same hashcode) we resolve this by
 * using a secondary hash.  The secondary hash is an increment
 * computed as a hash function (a different one) of the primary
 * hashcode.  This increment is added to the initial hash value to
 * obtain further slots assigned to the same hash code.  For this to
 * work, the length of the array and the increment must be relatively
 * prime.  The easiest way to achieve this is to have the length of
 * the array be prime, and the increment be any value from
 * 1..length-1.
 *
 * Hashcodes are 32-bit integers.  We make sure all hashcodes are
 * non-negative by masking off the top bit.  This has two effects: (1)
 * modulo arithmetic is simplified.  If we allowed negative hashcodes,
 * then when we computed hashcode % length, we could get a negative
 * result, which we would then have to adjust back into range.  It's
 * simpler to just make hashcodes non-negative. (2) It makes it easy
 * to check for empty vs. occupied slots in the table.  We just mark
 * empty or deleted slots with a negative hashcode.
 *
 * The central function is _uhash_find().  This function looks for a
 * slot matching the given key and hashcode.  If one is found, it
 * returns a pointer to that slot.  If the table is full, and no match
 * is found, it returns NULL -- in theory.  This would make the code
 * more complicated, since all callers of _uhash_find() would then
 * have to check for a NULL result.  To keep this from happening, we
 * don't allow the table to fill.  When there is only one
 * empty/deleted slot left, uhash_put() will refuse to increase the
 * count, and fail.  This simplifies the code.  In practice, one will
 * seldom encounter this using default UHashtables.  However, if a
 * hashtable is set to a U_FIXED resize policy, or if memory is
 * exhausted, then the table may fill.
 *
 * High and low water ratios control rehashing.  They establish levels
 * of fullness (from 0 to 1) outside of which the data array is
 * reallocated and repopulated.  Setting the low water ratio to zero
 * means the table will never shrink.  Setting the high water ratio to
 * one means the table will never grow.  The ratios should be
 * coordinated with the ratio between successive elements of the
 * PRIMES table, so that when the primeIndex is incremented or
 * decremented during rehashing, it brings the ratio of count / length
 * back into the desired range (between low and high water ratios).
