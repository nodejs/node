  LMBCS

  (Lotus Multi-Byte Character Set)

  LMBCS was invented in the late 1980's and is primarily used in Lotus Notes
  databases and in Lotus 1-2-3 files. Programmers who work with the APIs
  into these products will sometimes need to deal with strings in this format.

  The code in this file provides an implementation for an ICU converter of
  LMBCS to and from Unicode.

  Since the LMBCS character set is only sparsely documented in existing
  printed or online material, we have added  extensive annotation to this
  file to serve as a guide to understanding LMBCS.

  LMBCS was originally designed with these four sometimes-competing design goals:

  -Provide encodings for the characters in 12 existing national standards
   (plus a few other characters)
  -Minimal memory footprint
  -Maximal speed of conversion into the existing national character sets
  -No need to track a changing state as you interpret a string.


  All of the national character sets LMBCS was trying to encode are 'ANSI'
  based, in that the bytes from 0x20 - 0x7F are almost exactly the
  same common Latin unaccented characters and symbols in all character sets.

  So, in order to help meet the speed & memory design goals, the common ANSI
  bytes from 0x20-0x7F are represented by the same single-byte values in LMBCS.

  The general LMBCS code unit is from 1-3 bytes. We can describe the 3 bytes as
  follows:

  [G] D1 [D2]

  That is, a sometimes-optional 'group' byte, followed by 1 and sometimes 2
  data bytes. The maximum size of a LMBCS chjaracter is 3 bytes:
*/
#define ULMBCS_CHARSIZE_MAX      3
/*
  The single-byte values from 0x20 to 0x7F are examples of single D1 bytes.
  We often have to figure out if byte values are below or above this, so we
  use the ANSI nomenclature 'C0' and 'C1' to refer to the range of control
  characters just above & below the common lower-ANSI  range */
#define ULMBCS_C0END           0x1F
#define ULMBCS_C1START         0x80
/*
  Since LMBCS is always dealing in byte units. we create a local type here for
  dealing with these units of LMBCS code units:

*/
typedef uint8_t ulmbcs_byte_t;

/*
   Most of the values less than 0x20 are reserved in LMBCS to announce
   which national  character standard is being used for the 'D' bytes.
   In the comments we show the common name and the IBM character-set ID
   for these character-set announcers:
*/

#define ULMBCS_GRP_L1         0x01   /* Latin-1    :ibm-850  */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_GR         0x02   /* Greek      :ibm-851  */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_HE         0x03   /* Hebrew     :ibm-1255 */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_AR         0x04   /* Arabic     :ibm-1256 */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_RU         0x05   /* Cyrillic   :ibm-1251 */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_L2         0x06   /* Latin-2    :ibm-852  */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_TR         0x08   /* Turkish    :ibm-1254 */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_TH         0x0B   /* Thai       :ibm-874  */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_JA         0x10   /* Japanese   :ibm-943  */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_KO         0x11   /* Korean     :ibm-1261 */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_TW         0x12   /* Chinese SC :ibm-950  */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_CN         0x13   /* Chinese TC :ibm-1386 */

/*
   So, the beginning of understanding LMBCS is that IF the first byte of a LMBCS
   character is one of those 12 values, you can interpret the remaining bytes of
   that character as coming from one of those character sets. Since the lower
   ANSI bytes already are represented in single bytes, using one of the character
   set announcers is used to announce a character that starts with a byte of
   0x80 or greater.

   The character sets are  arranged so that the single byte sets all appear
   before the multi-byte character sets. When we need to tell whether a
   group byte is for a single byte char set or not we use this define: */

#define ULMBCS_DOUBLEOPTGROUP_START  0x10

/*
However, to fully understand LMBCS, you must also understand a series of
exceptions & optimizations made in service of the design goals.

First, those of you who are character set mavens may have noticed that
the 'double-byte' character sets are actually multi-byte character sets
that can have 1 or two bytes, even in the upper-ascii range. To force
each group byte to introduce a fixed-width encoding (to make it faster to
count characters), we use a convention of doubling up on the group byte
to introduce any single-byte character > 0x80 in an otherwise double-byte
character set. So, for example, the LMBCS sequence x10 x10 xAE is the
same as '0xAE' in the Japanese code page 943.

Next, you will notice that the list of group bytes has some gaps.
These are used in various ways.

We reserve a few special single byte values for common control
characters. These are in the same place as their ANSI eqivalents for speed.
*/

#define ULMBCS_HT    0x09   /* Fixed control char - Horizontal Tab */
#define ULMBCS_LF    0x0A   /* Fixed control char - Line Feed */
#define ULMBCS_CR    0x0D   /* Fixed control char - Carriage Return */

/* Then, 1-2-3 reserved a special single-byte character to put at the
beginning of internal 'system' range names: */

#define ULMBCS_123SYSTEMRANGE  0x19

/* Then we needed a place to put all the other ansi control characters
that must be moved to different values because LMBCS reserves those
values for other purposes. To represent the control characters, we start
with a first byte of 0xF & add the control chaarcter value as the
second byte */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_CTRL       0x0F

/* For the C0 controls (less than 0x20), we add 0x20 to preserve the
useful doctrine that any byte less than 0x20 in a LMBCS char must be
the first byte of a character:*/
#define ULMBCS_CTRLOFFSET      0x20

/*
Where to put the characters that aren't part of any of the 12 national
character sets? The first thing that was done, in the earlier years of
LMBCS, was to use up the spaces of the form

  [G] D1,

 where  'G' was one of the single-byte character groups, and
 D1 was less than 0x80. These sequences are gathered together
 into a Lotus-invented doublebyte character set to represent a
 lot of stray values. Internally, in this implementation, we track this
 as group '0', as a place to tuck this exceptions list.*/

#define ULMBCS_GRP_EXCEPT     0x00
/*
 Finally, as the durability and usefulness of UNICODE became clear,
 LOTUS added a new group 0x14 to hold Unicode values not otherwise
 represented in LMBCS: */
#define ULMBCS_GRP_UNICODE    0x14
/* The two bytes appearing after a 0x14 are intrepreted as UFT-16 BE
(Big-Endian) characters. The exception comes when the UTF16
representation would have a zero as the second byte. In that case,
'F6' is used in its place, and the bytes are swapped. (This prevents
LMBCS from encoding any Unicode values of the form U+F6xx, but that's OK:
0xF6xx is in the middle of the Private Use Area.)*/
#define ULMBCS_UNICOMPATZERO   0xF6

/* It is also useful in our code to have a constant for the size of
a LMBCS char that holds a literal Unicode value */
#define ULMBCS_UNICODE_SIZE      3

/*
To squish the LMBCS representations down even further, and to make
translations even faster,sometimes the optimization group byte can be dropped
from a LMBCS character. This is decided on a process-by-process basis. The
group byte that is dropped is called the 'optimization group'.

For Notes, the optimzation group is always 0x1.*/
#define ULMBCS_DEFAULTOPTGROUP 0x1
/* For 1-2-3 files, the optimzation group is stored in the header of the 1-2-3
file.

 In any case, when using ICU, you either pass in the
optimization group as part of the name of the converter (LMBCS-1, LMBCS-2,
etc.). Using plain 'LMBCS' as the name of the converter will give you
LMBCS-1.


*** Implementation strategy ***


Because of the extensive use of other character sets, the LMBCS converter
keeps a mapping between optimization groups and IBM character sets, so that
ICU converters can be created and used as needed. */

/* As you can see, even though any byte below 0x20 could be an optimization
byte, only those at 0x13 or below can map to an actual converter. To limit
some loops and searches, we define a value for that last group converter:*/

#define ULMBCS_GRP_LAST       0x13   /* last LMBCS group that has a converter */

static const char * const OptGroupByteToCPName[ULMBCS_GRP_LAST + 1] = {
   /* 0x0000 */ "lmb-excp", /* internal home for the LOTUS exceptions list */
   /* 0x0001 */ "ibm-850",
   /* 0x0002 */ "ibm-851",
   /* 0x0003 */ "windows-1255",
   /* 0x0004 */ "windows-1256",
   /* 0x0005 */ "windows-1251",
   /* 0x0006 */ "ibm-852",
   /* 0x0007 */ NULL,      /* Unused */
   /* 0x0008 */ "windows-1254",
   /* 0x0009 */ NULL,      /* Control char HT */
   /* 0x000A */ NULL,      /* Control char LF */
   /* 0x000B */ "windows-874",
   /* 0x000C */ NULL,      /* Unused */
   /* 0x000D */ NULL,      /* Control char CR */
   /* 0x000E */ NULL,      /* Unused */
   /* 0x000F */ NULL,      /* Control chars: 0x0F20 + C0/C1 character: algorithmic */
   /* 0x0010 */ "windows-932",
   /* 0x0011 */ "windows-949",
   /* 0x0012 */ "windows-950",
   /* 0x0013 */ "windows-936"

   /* The rest are null, including the 0x0014 Unicode compatibility region
   and 0x0019, the 1-2-3 system range control char */
};


/* That's approximately all the data that's needed for translating
  LMBCS to Unicode.


However, to translate Unicode to LMBCS, we need some more support.

That's because there are often more than one possible mappings from a Unicode
code point back into LMBCS. The first thing we do is look up into a table
to figure out if there are more than one possible mappings. This table,
arranged by Unicode values (including ranges) either lists which group
to use, or says that it could go into one or more of the SBCS sets, or
into one or more of the DBCS sets.  (If the character exists in both DBCS &
SBCS, the table will place it in the SBCS sets, to make the LMBCS code point
length as small as possible. Here's the two special markers we use to indicate
ambiguous mappings: */

#define ULMBCS_AMBIGUOUS_SBCS   0x80   /* could fit in more than one
                                          LMBCS sbcs native encoding
                                          (example: most accented latin) */

#define ULMBCS_AMBIGUOUS_ALL   0x82
/* And here's a simple way to see if a group falls in an appropriate range */
#define ULMBCS_AMBIGUOUS_MATCH(agroup, xgroup) \
