*
*   The current code in this file replaces the previous implementation
*   of conversion code from multi-byte codepages to Unicode and back.
*   This implementation supports the following:
*   - legacy variable-length codepages with up to 4 bytes per character
*   - all Unicode code points (up to 0x10ffff)
*   - efficient distinction of unassigned vs. illegal byte sequences
*   - it is possible in fromUnicode() to directly deal with simple
*     stateful encodings (used for EBCDIC_STATEFUL)
*   - it is possible to convert Unicode code points
*     to a single zero byte (but not as a fallback except for SBCS)
*
*   Remaining limitations in fromUnicode:
*   - byte sequences must not have leading zero bytes
*   - except for SBCS codepages: no fallback mapping from Unicode to a zero byte
*   - limitation to up to 4 bytes per character
*
*   ICU 2.8 (late 2003) adds a secondary data structure which lifts some of these
*   limitations and adds m:n character mappings and other features.
*   See ucnv_ext.h for details.
*
*   Change history:
*
*    5/6/2001       Ram       Moved  MBCS_SINGLE_RESULT_FROM_U,MBCS_STAGE_2_FROM_U,
*                             MBCS_VALUE_2_FROM_STAGE_2, MBCS_VALUE_4_FROM_STAGE_2

 * _MBCSHeader versions 5.3 & 4.3
 * (Note that the _MBCSHeader version is in addition to the converter formatVersion.)
 *
 * This version is optional. Version 5 is used for incompatible data format changes.
 * makeconv will continue to generate version 4 files if possible.
 *
 * Changes from version 4:
 *
 * The main difference is an additional _MBCSHeader field with
 * - the length (number of uint32_t) of the _MBCSHeader
 * - flags for further incompatible data format changes
 * - flags for further, backward compatible data format changes
 *
 * The MBCS_OPT_FROM_U flag indicates that most of the fromUnicode data is omitted from
 * the file and needs to be reconstituted at load time.
 * This requires a utf8Friendly format with an additional mbcsIndex table for fast
 * (and UTF-8-friendly) fromUnicode conversion for Unicode code points up to maxFastUChar.
 * (For details about these structures see below, and see ucnvmbcs.h.)
 *
 *   utf8Friendly also implies that the fromUnicode mappings are stored in ascending order
 *   of the Unicode code points. (This requires that the .ucm file has the |0 etc.
 *   precision markers for all mappings.)
 *
 *   All fallbacks have been moved to the extension table, leaving only roundtrips in the
 *   omitted data that can be reconstituted from the toUnicode data.
 *
 *   Of the stage 2 table, the part corresponding to maxFastUChar and below is omitted.
 *   With only roundtrip mappings in the base fromUnicode data, this part is fully
 *   redundant with the mbcsIndex and will be reconstituted from that (also using the
 *   stage 1 table which contains the information about how stage 2 was compacted).
 *
 *   The rest of the stage 2 table, the part for code points above maxFastUChar,
 *   is stored in the file and will be appended to the reconstituted part.
 *
 *   The entire fromUBytes array is omitted from the file and will be reconstitued.
 *   This is done by enumerating all toUnicode roundtrip mappings, performing
 *   each mapping (using the stage 1 and reconstituted stage 2 tables) and
 *   writing instead of reading the byte values.
 *
 * _MBCSHeader version 4.3
 *
 * Change from version 4.2:
 * - Optional utf8Friendly data structures, with 64-entry stage 3 block
 *   allocation for parts of the BMP, and an additional mbcsIndex in non-SBCS
 *   files which can be used instead of stages 1 & 2.
 *   Faster lookups for roundtrips from most commonly used characters,
 *   and lookups from UTF-8 byte sequences with a natural bit distribution.
 *   See ucnvmbcs.h for more details.
 *
 * Change from version 4.1:
 * - Added an optional extension table structure at the end of the .cnv file.
 *   It is present if the upper bits of the header flags field contains a non-zero
 *   byte offset to it.
 *   Files that contain only a conversion table and no base table
 *   use the special outputType MBCS_OUTPUT_EXT_ONLY.
 *   These contain the base table name between the MBCS header and the extension
 *   data.
 *
 * Change from version 4.0:
 * - Replace header.reserved with header.fromUBytesLength so that all
 *   fields in the data have length.
 *
 * Changes from version 3 (for performance improvements):
 * - new bit distribution for state table entries
 * - reordered action codes
 * - new data structure for single-byte fromUnicode
 *   + stage 2 only contains indexes
 *   + stage 3 stores 16 bits per character with classification bits 15..8
 * - no multiplier for stage 1 entries
 * - stage 2 for non-single-byte codepages contains the index and the flags in
 *   one 32-bit value
 * - 2-byte and 4-byte fromUnicode results are stored directly as 16/32-bit integers
 *
 * For more details about old versions of the MBCS data structure, see
 * the corresponding versions of this file.
 *
 * Converting stateless codepage data ---------------------------------------***
 * (or codepage data with simple states) to Unicode.
 *
 * Data structure and algorithm for converting from complex legacy codepages
 * to Unicode. (Designed before 2000-may-22.)
 *
 * The basic idea is that the structure of legacy codepages can be described
 * with state tables.
 * When reading a byte stream, each input byte causes a state transition.
 * Some transitions result in the output of a code point, some result in
 * "unassigned" or "illegal" output.
 * This is used here for character conversion.
 *
 * The data structure begins with a state table consisting of a row
 * per state, with 256 entries (columns) per row for each possible input
 * byte value.
 * Each entry is 32 bits wide, with two formats distinguished by
 * the sign bit (bit 31):
 *
 * One format for transitional entries (bit 31 not set) for non-final bytes, and
 * one format for final entries (bit 31 set).
 * Both formats contain the number of the next state in the same bit
 * positions.
 * State 0 is the initial state.
 *
 * Most of the time, the offset values of subsequent states are added
 * up to a scalar value. This value will eventually be the index of
 * the Unicode code point in a table that follows the state table.
 * The effect is that the code points for final state table rows
 * are contiguous. The code points of final state rows follow each other
 * in the order of the references to those final states by previous
 * states, etc.
 *
 * For some terminal states, the offset is itself the output Unicode
 * code point (16 bits for a BMP code point or 20 bits for a supplementary
 * code point (stored as code point minus 0x10000 so that 20 bits are enough).
 * For others, the code point in the Unicode table is stored with either
 * one or two code units: one for BMP code points, two for a pair of
 * surrogates.
 * All code points for a final state entry take up the same number of code
 * units, regardless of whether they all actually _use_ the same number
 * of code units. This is necessary for simple array access.
 *
 * An additional feature comes in with what in ICU is called "fallback"
 * mappings:
 *
 * In addition to round-trippable, precise, 1:1 mappings, there are often
 * mappings defined between similar, though not the same, characters.
 * Typically, such mappings occur only in fromUnicode mapping tables because
 * Unicode has a superset repertoire of most other codepages. However, it
 * is possible to provide such mappings in the toUnicode tables, too.
 * In this case, the fallback mappings are partly integrated into the
 * general state tables because the structure of the encoding includes their
 * byte sequences.
 * For final entries in an initial state, fallback mappings are stored in
 * the entry itself like with roundtrip mappings.
 * For other final entries, they are stored in the code units table if
 * the entry is for a pair of code units.
 * For single-unit results in the code units table, there is no space to
 * alternatively hold a fallback mapping; in this case, the code unit
 * is stored as U+fffe (unassigned), and the fallback mapping needs to
 * be looked up by the scalar offset value in a separate table.
 *
 * "Unassigned" state entries really mean "structurally unassigned",
 * i.e., such a byte sequence will never have a mapping result.
 *
 * The interpretation of the bits in each entry is as follows:
 *
 * Bit 31 not set, not a terminal entry ("transitional"):
 * 30..24 next state
 * 23..0  offset delta, to be added up
 *
 * Bit 31 set, terminal ("final") entry:
 * 30..24 next state (regardless of action code)
 * 23..20 action code:
 *        action codes 0 and 1 result in precise-mapping Unicode code points
 *        0  valid byte sequence
 *           19..16 not used, 0
 *           15..0  16-bit Unicode BMP code point
 *                  never U+fffe or U+ffff
 *        1  valid byte sequence
 *           19..0  20-bit Unicode supplementary code point
 *                  never U+fffe or U+ffff
 *
 *        action codes 2 and 3 result in fallback (unidirectional-mapping) Unicode code points
 *        2  valid byte sequence (fallback)
 *           19..16 not used, 0
 *           15..0  16-bit Unicode BMP code point as fallback result
 *        3  valid byte sequence (fallback)
 *           19..0  20-bit Unicode supplementary code point as fallback result
 *
 *        action codes 4 and 5 may result in roundtrip/fallback/unassigned/illegal results
 *        depending on the code units they result in
 *        4  valid byte sequence
 *           19..9  not used, 0
 *            8..0  final offset delta
 *                  pointing to one 16-bit code unit which may be
 *                  fffe  unassigned -- look for a fallback for this offset
 *                  ffff  illegal
 *        5  valid byte sequence
 *           19..9  not used, 0
 *            8..0  final offset delta
 *                  pointing to two 16-bit code units
 *                  (typically UTF-16 surrogates)
 *                  the result depends on the first code unit as follows:
 *                  0000..d7ff  roundtrip BMP code point (1st alone)
 *                  d800..dbff  roundtrip surrogate pair (1st, 2nd)
 *                  dc00..dfff  fallback surrogate pair (1st-400, 2nd)
 *                  e000        roundtrip BMP code point (2nd alone)
 *                  e001        fallback BMP code point (2nd alone)
 *                  fffe        unassigned
 *                  ffff        illegal
 *           (the final offset deltas are at most 255 * 2,
 *            times 2 because of storing code unit pairs)
 *
 *        6  unassigned byte sequence
 *           19..16 not used, 0
 *           15..0  16-bit Unicode BMP code point U+fffe (new with version 2)
 *                  this does not contain a final offset delta because the main
 *                  purpose of this action code is to save scalar offset values;
 *                  therefore, fallback values cannot be assigned to byte
 *                  sequences that result in this action code
 *        7  illegal byte sequence
 *           19..16 not used, 0
 *           15..0  16-bit Unicode BMP code point U+ffff (new with version 2)
 *        8  state change only
 *           19..0  not used, 0
 *           useful for state changes in simple stateful encodings,
 *           at Shift-In/Shift-Out codes
 *
 *
 *        9..15 reserved for future use
 *           current implementations will only perform a state change
 *           and ignore bits 19..0
 *
 * An encoding with contiguous ranges of unassigned byte sequences, like
 * Shift-JIS and especially EUC-TW, can be stored efficiently by having
 * at least two states for the trail bytes:
 * One trail byte state that results in code points, and one that only
 * has "unassigned" and "illegal" terminal states.
 *
 * Note: partly by accident, this data structure supports simple stateful
 * encodings without any additional logic.
 * Currently, only simple Shift-In/Shift-Out schemes are handled with
 * appropriate state tables (especially EBCDIC_STATEFUL!).
 *
 * MBCS version 2 added:
 * unassigned and illegal action codes have U+fffe and U+ffff
 * instead of unused bits; this is useful for _MBCS_SINGLE_SIMPLE_GET_NEXT_BMP()
 *
 * Converting from Unicode to codepage bytes --------------------------------***
 *
 * The conversion data structure for fromUnicode is designed for the known
 * structure of Unicode. It maps from 21-bit code points (0..0x10ffff) to
 * a sequence of 1..4 bytes, in addition to a flag that indicates if there is
 * a roundtrip mapping.
 *
 * The lookup is done with a 3-stage trie, using 11/6/4 bits for stage 1/2/3
 * like in the character properties table.
 * The beginning of the trie is at offsetFromUTable, the beginning of stage 3
 * with the resulting bytes is at offsetFromUBytes.
 *
 * Beginning with version 4, single-byte codepages have a significantly different
 * trie compared to other codepages.
 * In all cases, the entry in stage 1 is directly the index of the block of
 * 64 entries in stage 2.
 *
 * Single-byte lookup:
 *
 * Stage 2 only contains 16-bit indexes directly to the 16-blocks in stage 3.
 * Stage 3 contains one 16-bit word per result:
 * Bits 15..8 indicate the kind of result:
 *    f  roundtrip result
 *    c  fallback result from private-use code point
 *    8  fallback result from other code points
 *    0  unassigned
 * Bits 7..0 contain the codepage byte. A zero byte is always possible.
 *
 * In version 4.3, the runtime code can build an sbcsIndex for a utf8Friendly
 * file. For 2-byte UTF-8 byte sequences and some 3-byte sequences the lookup
 * becomes a 2-stage (single-index) trie lookup with 6 bits for stage 3.
 * ASCII code points can be looked up with a linear array access into stage 3.
 * See maxFastUChar and other details in ucnvmbcs.h.
 *
 * Multi-byte lookup:
 *
 * Stage 2 contains a 32-bit word for each 16-block in stage 3:
 * Bits 31..16 contain flags for which stage 3 entries contain roundtrip results
 *             test: MBCS_FROM_U_IS_ROUNDTRIP(stage2Entry, c)
 *             If this test is false, then a non-zero result will be interpreted as
 *             a fallback mapping.
 * Bits 15..0  contain the index to stage 3, which must be multiplied by 16*(bytes per char)
 *
 * Stage 3 contains 2, 3, or 4 bytes per result.
 * 2 or 4 bytes are stored as uint16_t/uint32_t in platform endianness,
 * while 3 bytes are stored as bytes in big-endian order.
 * Leading zero bytes are ignored, and the number of bytes is counted.
 * A zero byte mapping result is possible as a roundtrip result.
 * For some output types, the actual result is processed from this;
 * see ucnv_MBCSFromUnicodeWithOffsets().
 *
 * Note that stage 1 always contains 0x440=1088 entries (0x440==0x110000>>10),
 * or (version 3 and up) for BMP-only codepages, it contains 64 entries.
 *
 * In version 4.3, a utf8Friendly file contains an mbcsIndex table.
 * For 2-byte UTF-8 byte sequences and most 3-byte sequences the lookup
 * becomes a 2-stage (single-index) trie lookup with 6 bits for stage 3.
 * ASCII code points can be looked up with a linear array access into stage 3.
 * See maxFastUChar, mbcsIndex and other details in ucnvmbcs.h.
 *
 * In version 3, stage 2 blocks may overlap by multiples of the multiplier
 * for compaction.
 * In version 4, stage 2 blocks (and for single-byte codepages, stage 3 blocks)
 * may overlap by any number of entries.
 *
 * MBCS version 2 added:
 * the converter checks for known output types, which allows
 * adding new ones without crashing an unaware converter
