*
* Private implementation header for C/C++ collation.
* Some file data structure definitions were moved here from i18n/ucol_imp.h
* so that the common library (via ucol_swp.cpp) need not depend on the i18n library at all.
*
* We do not want to move the collation swapper to the i18n library because
* a) the resource bundle swapper depends on it and would have to move too, and
* b) we might want to eventually implement runtime data swapping,
*    which might (or might not) be easier if all swappers are in the common library.
