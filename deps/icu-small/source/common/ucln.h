/** These are the functions used to register a library's memory cleanup
 * functions.  Each library should define a single library register function
 * to call this API.  In the i18n library, it is ucln_i18n_registerCleanup().
 *
 * None of the cleanup functions should use a mutex to clean up an API's
 * allocated memory because a cleanup function is not meant to be thread safe,
 * and plenty of data cannot be reference counted in order to make sure that
 * no one else needs the allocated data.
 *
 * In order to make a cleanup function get called when u_cleanup is called,
 * You should add your function to the library specific cleanup function.
 * If the cleanup function is not in the common library, the code that
 * allocates the memory should call the library specific cleanup function.
 * For instance, in the i18n library, any memory allocated statically must
 * call ucln_i18n_registerCleanup() from the ucln_in.h header.  These library
 * cleanup functions are needed in order to prevent a circular dependency
 * between the common library and any other library.
 *
 * The order of the cleanup is very important.  In general, an API that
 * depends on a second API should be cleaned up before the second API.
 * For instance, the default converter in ustring depends upon the converter
 * API.  So the default converter should be closed before the converter API
 * has its cache flushed.  This will prevent any memory leaks due to
 * reference counting.
 *
 * Please see common/ucln_cmn.{h,c} and i18n/ucln_in.{h,c} for examples.
