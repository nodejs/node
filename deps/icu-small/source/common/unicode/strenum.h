 */
 
U_NAMESPACE_BEGIN

/**
 * Base class for 'pure' C++ implementations of uenum api.  Adds a
 * method that returns the next UnicodeString since in C++ this can
 * be a common storage format for strings.
 *
 * <p>The model is that the enumeration is over strings maintained by
 * a 'service.'  At any point, the service might change, invalidating
 * the enumerator (though this is expected to be rare).  The iterator
 * returns an error if this has occurred.  Lack of the error is no
 * guarantee that the service didn't change immediately after the
 * call, so the returned string still might not be 'valid' on
 * subsequent use.</p>
 *
 * <p>Strings may take the form of const char*, const char16_t*, or const
 * UnicodeString*.  The type you get is determine by the variant of
 * 'next' that you call.  In general the StringEnumeration is
 * optimized for one of these types, but all StringEnumerations can
 * return all types.  Returned strings are each terminated with a NUL.
 * Depending on the service data, they might also include embedded NUL
 * characters, so API is provided to optionally return the true
 * length, counting the embedded NULs but not counting the terminating
 * NUL.</p>
 *
 * <p>The pointers returned by next, unext, and snext become invalid
 * upon any subsequent call to the enumeration's destructor, next,
 * unext, snext, or reset.</p>
 *
 * ICU 2.8 adds some default implementations and helper functions
 * for subclasses.
