class UnicodeString;

/**
 * <code>Replaceable</code> is an abstract base class representing a
 * string of characters that supports the replacement of a range of
 * itself with a new string of characters.  It is used by APIs that
 * change a piece of text while retaining metadata.  Metadata is data
 * other than the Unicode characters returned by char32At().  One
 * example of metadata is style attributes; another is an edit
 * history, marking each character with an author and revision number.
 *
 * <p>An implicit aspect of the <code>Replaceable</code> API is that
 * during a replace operation, new characters take on the metadata of
 * the old characters.  For example, if the string "the <b>bold</b>
 * font" has range (4, 8) replaced with "strong", then it becomes "the
 * <b>strong</b> font".
 *
 * <p><code>Replaceable</code> specifies ranges using a start
 * offset and a limit offset.  The range of characters thus specified
 * includes the characters at offset start..limit-1.  That is, the
 * start offset is inclusive, and the limit offset is exclusive.
 *
 * <p><code>Replaceable</code> also includes API to access characters
 * in the string: <code>length()</code>, <code>charAt()</code>,
 * <code>char32At()</code>, and <code>extractBetween()</code>.
 *
 * <p>For a subclass to support metadata, typical behavior of
 * <code>replace()</code> is the following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Set the metadata of the new text to the metadata of the first
 *   character replaced</li>
 *   <li>If no characters are replaced, use the metadata of the
 *   previous character</li>
 *   <li>If there is no previous character (i.e. start == 0), use the
 *   following character</li>
 *   <li>If there is no following character (i.e. the replaceable was
 *   empty), use default metadata.<br>
 *   <li>If the code point U+FFFF is seen, it should be interpreted as
 *   a special marker having no metadata<li>
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 * If this is not the behavior, the subclass should document any differences.
