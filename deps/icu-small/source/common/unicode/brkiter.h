/**
 * The BreakIterator class implements methods for finding the location
 * of boundaries in text. BreakIterator is an abstract base class.
 * Instances of BreakIterator maintain a current position and scan over
 * text returning the index of characters where boundaries occur.
 * <p>
 * Line boundary analysis determines where a text string can be broken
 * when line-wrapping. The mechanism correctly handles punctuation and
 * hyphenated words.
 * <p>
 * Sentence boundary analysis allows selection with correct
 * interpretation of periods within numbers and abbreviations, and
 * trailing punctuation marks such as quotation marks and parentheses.
 * <p>
 * Word boundary analysis is used by search and replace functions, as
 * well as within text editing applications that allow the user to
 * select words with a double click. Word selection provides correct
 * interpretation of punctuation marks within and following
 * words. Characters that are not part of a word, such as symbols or
 * punctuation marks, have word-breaks on both sides.
 * <p>
 * Character boundary analysis allows users to interact with
 * characters as they expect to, for example, when moving the cursor
 * through a text string. Character boundary analysis provides correct
 * navigation of through character strings, regardless of how the
 * character is stored.  For example, an accented character might be
 * stored as a base character and a diacritical mark. What users
 * consider to be a character can differ between languages.
 * <p>
 * The text boundary positions are found according to the rules
 * described in Unicode Standard Annex #29, Text Boundaries, and
 * Unicode Standard Annex #14, Line Breaking Properties.  These
 * are available at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/ and
 * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the C++ API defined in this header file, a
 * plain C API with equivalent functionality is defined in the
 * file ubrk.h
 * <p>
 * Code snippets illustrating the use of the Break Iterator APIs
 * are available in the ICU User Guide,
 * http://icu-project.org/userguide/boundaryAnalysis.html
 * and in the sample program icu/source/samples/break/break.cpp

     *  This function is intended for use in environments where ICU is operating on
     *  strings that may move around in memory.  It provides a mechanism for notifying
     *  ICU that the string has been relocated, and providing a new UText to access the
     *  string in its new position.

     *  Note that the break iterator implementation never copies the underlying text
     *  of a string being processed, but always operates directly on the original text
     *  provided by the user. Refreshing simply drops the references to the old text
     *  and replaces them with references to the new.
     *
     *  Caution:  this function is normally used only by very specialized,
     *  system-level code.  One example use case is with garbage collection that moves
     *  the text in memory.
