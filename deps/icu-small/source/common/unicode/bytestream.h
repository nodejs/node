// Abstract interface that consumes a sequence of bytes (ByteSink).
//
// Used so that we can write a single piece of code that can operate
// on a variety of output string types.
//
// Various implementations of this interface are provided:
//   ByteSink:
//      CheckedArrayByteSink    Write to a flat array, with bounds checking
//      StringByteSink          Write to an STL string

// This code is a contribution of Google code, and the style used here is
// a compromise between the original Google code and the ICU coding guidelines.
// For example, data types are ICU-ified (size_t,int->int32_t),
// and API comments doxygen-ified, but function names and behavior are
// as in the original, if possible.
// Assertion-style error handling, not available in ICU, was changed to
// parameter "pinning" similar to UnicodeString.
//
// In addition, this is only a partial port of the original Google code,
// limited to what was needed so far. The (nearly) complete original code
// is in the ICU svn repository at icuhtml/trunk/design/strings/contrib
// (see ICU ticket 6765, r25517).

   * on this ByteSink.
   *
   * After writing at most *result_capacity bytes, call Append() with the
   * pointer returned from this function and the number of bytes written.
   * Many Append() implementations will avoid copying bytes if this function
   * returned an internal buffer.
   *
   * Partial usage example:
   *  int32_t capacity;
   *  char* buffer = sink->GetAppendBuffer(..., &capacity);
   *  ... Write n bytes into buffer, with n <= capacity.
   *  sink->Append(buffer, n);
   * In many implementations, that call to Append will avoid copying bytes.
   *
   * If the ByteSink allocates or reallocates an internal buffer, it should use
   * the desired_capacity_hint if appropriate.
   * If a caller cannot provide a reasonable guess at the desired capacity,
   * it should pass desired_capacity_hint=0.
   *
   * If a non-scratch buffer is returned, the caller may only pass
   * a prefix to it to Append().
   * That is, it is not correct to pass an interior pointer to Append().
   *
   * The default implementation always returns the scratch buffer.
