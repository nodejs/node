/*
 *
 * ICU trace format string syntax
 *
 * Format Strings are passed to UTraceData functions, and define the
 * number and types of the trace data being passed on each call.
 *
 * The UTraceData function, which is supplied by the application,
 * not by ICU, can either forward the trace data (passed via
 * varargs) and the format string back to ICU for formatting into
 * a displayable string, or it can interpret the format itself,
 * and do as it wishes with the trace data.
 *
 *
 * Goals for the format string
 * - basic data output
 * - easy to use for trace programmer
 * - sufficient provision for data types for trace output readability
 * - well-defined types and binary portable APIs
 *
 * Non-goals
 * - printf compatibility
 * - fancy formatting
 * - argument reordering and other internationalization features
 *
 * ICU trace format strings contain plain text with argument inserts,
 * much like standard printf format strings.
 * Each insert begins with a '%', then optionally contains a 'v',
 * then exactly one type character.
 * Two '%' in a row represent a '%' instead of an insert.
 * The trace format strings need not have \n at the end.
 *
 *
 * Types
 * -----
 *
 * Type characters:
 * - c A char character in the default codepage.
 * - s A NUL-terminated char * string in the default codepage.
 * - S A UChar * string.  Requires two params, (ptr, length).  Length=-1 for nul term.
 * - b A byte (8-bit integer).
 * - h A 16-bit integer.  Also a 16 bit Unicode code unit.
 * - d A 32-bit integer.  Also a 20 bit Unicode code point value. 
 * - l A 64-bit integer.
 * - p A data pointer.
 *
 * Vectors
 * -------
 *
 * If the 'v' is not specified, then one item of the specified type
 * is passed in.
 * If the 'v' (for "vector") is specified, then a vector of items of the
 * specified type is passed in, via a pointer to the first item
 * and an int32_t value for the length of the vector.
 * Length==-1 means zero or NUL termination.  Works for vectors of all types.
 *
 * Note:  %vS is a vector of (UChar *) strings.  The strings must
 *        be nul terminated as there is no way to provide a
 *        separate length parameter for each string.  The length
 *        parameter (required for all vectors) is the number of
 *        strings, not the length of the strings.
 *
 * Examples
 * --------
 *
 * These examples show the parameters that will be passed to an application's
 *   UTraceData() function for various formats.
 *
 * - the precise formatting is up to the application!
 * - the examples use type casts for arguments only to _show_ the types of
 *   arguments without needing variable declarations in the examples;
 *   the type casts will not be necessary in actual code
 *
 * UTraceDataFunc(context, fnNumber, level,
 *              "There is a character %c in the string %s.",   // Format String 
 *              (char)c, (const char *)s);                     // varargs parameters
 * ->   There is a character 0x42 'B' in the string "Bravo".
 *
 * UTraceDataFunc(context, fnNumber, level,
 *              "Vector of bytes %vb vector of chars %vc",
 *              (const uint8_t *)bytes, (int32_t)bytesLength,
 *              (const char *)chars, (int32_t)charsLength);
 * ->  Vector of bytes
 *      42 63 64 3f [4]
 *     vector of chars
 *      "Bcd?"[4]
 *
 * UTraceDataFunc(context, fnNumber, level,
 *              "An int32_t %d and a whole bunch of them %vd",
 *              (int32_t)-5, (const int32_t *)ints, (int32_t)intsLength);
