/**
 * \file
 * \brief C API: Code point macros
 *
 * This file defines macros for checking whether a code point is
 * a surrogate or a non-character etc.
 *
 * If U_NO_DEFAULT_INCLUDE_UTF_HEADERS is 0 then utf.h is included by utypes.h
 * and itself includes utf8.h and utf16.h after some
 * common definitions.
 * If U_NO_DEFAULT_INCLUDE_UTF_HEADERS is 1 then each of these headers must be
 * included explicitly if their definitions are used.
 *
 * utf8.h and utf16.h define macros for efficiently getting code points
 * in and out of UTF-8/16 strings.
 * utf16.h macros have "U16_" prefixes.
 * utf8.h defines similar macros with "U8_" prefixes for UTF-8 string handling.
 *
 * ICU mostly processes 16-bit Unicode strings.
 * Most of the time, such strings are well-formed UTF-16.
 * Single, unpaired surrogates must be handled as well, and are treated in ICU
 * like regular code points where possible.
 * (Pairs of surrogate code points are indistinguishable from supplementary
 * code points encoded as pairs of supplementary code units.)
 *
 * In fact, almost all Unicode code points in normal text (>99%)
 * are on the BMP (<=U+ffff) and even <=U+d7ff.
 * ICU functions handle supplementary code points (U+10000..U+10ffff)
 * but are optimized for the much more frequently occurring BMP code points.
 *
 * umachine.h defines UChar to be an unsigned 16-bit integer.
 * Since ICU 59, ICU uses char16_t in C++, UChar only in C,
 * and defines UChar=char16_t by default. See the UChar API docs for details.
 *
 * UChar32 is defined to be a signed 32-bit integer (int32_t), large enough for a 21-bit
 * Unicode code point (Unicode scalar value, 0..0x10ffff) and U_SENTINEL (-1).
 * Before ICU 2.4, the definition of UChar32 was similarly platform-dependent as
 * the definition of UChar. For details see the documentation for UChar32 itself.
 *
 * utf.h defines a small number of C macros for single Unicode code points.
 * These are simple checks for surrogates and non-characters.
 * For actual Unicode character properties see uchar.h.
 *
 * By default, string operations must be done with error checking in case
 * a string is not well-formed UTF-16 or UTF-8.
 *
 * The U16_ macros detect if a surrogate code unit is unpaired
 * (lead unit without trail unit or vice versa) and just return the unit itself
 * as the code point.
 *
 * The U8_ macros detect illegal byte sequences and return a negative value.
 * Starting with ICU 60, the observable length of a single illegal byte sequence
 * skipped by one of these macros follows the Unicode 6+ recommendation
 * which is consistent with the W3C Encoding Standard.
 *
 * There are ..._OR_FFFD versions of both U16_ and U8_ macros
 * that return U+FFFD for illegal code unit sequences.
 *
 * The regular "safe" macros require that the initial, passed-in string index
 * is within bounds. They only check the index when they read more than one
 * code unit. This is usually done with code similar to the following loop:
 * <pre>while(i<length) {
 *   U16_NEXT(s, i, length, c);
 *   // use c
 * }</pre>
 *
 * When it is safe to assume that text is well-formed UTF-16
 * (does not contain single, unpaired surrogates), then one can use
 * U16_..._UNSAFE macros.
 * These do not check for proper code unit sequences or truncated text and may
 * yield wrong results or even cause a crash if they are used with "malformed"
 * text.
 * In practice, U16_..._UNSAFE macros will produce slightly less code but
 * should not be faster because the processing is only different when a
 * surrogate code unit is detected, which will be rare.
 *
 * Similarly for UTF-8, there are "safe" macros without a suffix,
 * and U8_..._UNSAFE versions.
 * The performance differences are much larger here because UTF-8 provides so
 * many opportunities for malformed sequences.
 * The unsafe UTF-8 macros are entirely implemented inside the macro definitions
 * and are fast, while the safe UTF-8 macros call functions for some complicated cases.
 *
 * Unlike with UTF-16, malformed sequences cannot be expressed with distinct
 * code point values (0..U+10ffff). They are indicated with negative values instead.
 *
 * For more information see the ICU User Guide Strings chapter
 * (https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/strings).
 *
 * <em>Usage:</em>
 * ICU coding guidelines for if() statements should be followed when using these macros.
 * Compound statements (curly braces {}) must be used  for if-else-while... 
 * bodies and all macro statements should be terminated with semicolon.
