.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
The DNS library, \fBudns\fR, implements thread-safe stub DNS resolver
functionality, which may be used both traditional, syncronous way
and asyncronously, with application-supplied event loop.

.PP
While DNS works with both TCP and UDP, performing UDP query first and
if the result does not fit in UDP buffer (512 bytes max for original
DNS protocol), retrying the query over TCP, the library uses UDP only,
but uses EDNS0 (RFC2671) extensions which allows larger UDP buffers.

.PP
The library uses single UDP socket to perform all operations even when
asking multiple nameservers.  This way, it is very simple to use the
library in asyncronous event-loop applications: an application should
add only single socket to the set of filedescriptors it monitors for I/O.

.PP
The library uses two main objects, \fIresolver context\fR of type
\fBstruct\ dns_ctx\fR, and \fIquery structure\fR of type
\fBstruct\ dns_query\fR, both are opaque for an application.
Resolver context holds global information about the resolver,
such as list of nameservers to use, list of active requests and the like.
Query objects holds information about a single DNS query in progress and
are allocated/processed/freed by the library.   Pointer to query structure
may be treated as an identifier of an in-progress query and may be used
to cancel the asyncronous query or to wait for it to complete.

.PP
Asyncronous interface works as follows.  An application initializes
resolver context, submits any number of queries for it using one of
supplied \fBdns_submit_\fIXXX\fR() routines (each return the query
identifier as pointer to query structure), waits for input on the
UDP socket used by the library, and gives some control to the library
by calling \fBdns_ioevent\fR() and \fBdns_timeouts\fR() routines when
appropriate.  The library performs all necessary processing and executes
application supplied callback routine when a query completes (either
successefully or not), giving it the result if any, pointer to the
resolver context (from which completion status may be obtained), and
the data pointer supplied by an application when the query has been
submitted.  When submitting a query, an application requests how to
handle the reply -- to either return raw DNS reply packet for its
own low-level processing, or it may provide an address of \fIparsing
routine\fR of type \fBdns_parse_fn\fR to perform conversion of on-wire
format into easy to use data structure (the library provides parsing
routines for several commonly used resource record types, as well as
type-safe higher-level inteface that requests parsing automatically).
The I/O monitoring and timeout handling may be either traditional
select() or poll() based, or any callback-driven technique may be
used.

.PP
Additionally, the library provides traditional syncronous interface,
which may be intermixed with asyncronous calls (during syncronous
query processing, other asyncronous queries for the same resolver
context continued to be processed as usual).  An application uses
one of numerous \fBdns_resolve_\fIXXX\fR() routines provided by the
library to perform a query.  As with asyncronous interface, an
application may either request to return raw DNS packet or type-specific
data structure by providing the parsing routine to handle the reply.
Every routine from \fBdns_resolve_\fIXXX\fR() series return pointer
to result or NULL in case of any error.  Query completion status
(or length of the raw DNS packet) is available from the resolver
context using \fBdns_status\fR() routine, the same way as for the
asyncronous interface.

.PP
Internally, library uses on-wire format of domain names, referred
to as \fIDN format\fR in this manual page.  This is a series of domain
\fIlabels\fR whith preceeding length byte, terminated by zero-length
label wich is integral part of the DN format.  There are several routines
provided to convert from traditional asciiz string to DN and back.
Higher-level type-specific query interface hides the DN format from
an application.

.SH "COMMON DEFINITIONS"

.PP
Every DNS Resource Record (RR) has a \fItype\fR and a \fIclass\fR.
The library defines several integer constants, \fBDNS_C_\fIXXX\fR and
\fBDNS_T_\fIXXX\fR, to use as symbolic names for RR classes and types,
such as \fBDNS_C_IN\fR for Internet class, \fBDNS_T_A\fR for IPv4
address record type and so on.  See udns.h header file for complete list
of all such constants.

.PP
The following constants are defined in udns.h header file:
.IP "\fBDNS_MAXDN\fR (255 bytes)"
Maximum length of the domain name in internal (on-wire) DN format.
.IP "\fBDNS_MAXLABEL\fR (63 bytes)"
Maximum length of a single label in DN format.
.IP "\fBDNS_MAXNAME\fR (1024 bytes)"
Maximum length of asciiz format of a domain name.
.IP "\fBDNS_HSIZE\fR (12 bytes)"
Size of header in DNS packet.
.IP "\fBDNS_PORT\fR (53)"
Default port to use when contacting a DNS server.
.IP "\fBDNS_MAXSERV\fR (6 servers)"
Maximum number of DNS servers to use.
.IP "\fBDNS_MAXPACKET\fR (512 bytes)"
Maximum length of DNS UDP packet as specified by original DNS protocol
.IP "\fBDNS_EDNS0PACKET\fR (4096 bytes)"
Default length of DNS UDP packet (with EDNS0 extensions) the library uses.
Note that recursive nameservers usually resides near the client asking them
to resolve names, e.g. on the same LAN segment or even on the same host, so
UDP packet fragmentation isn't a problem in most cases.  Note also that
the size of actual packets will be as many bytes as actual reply size requires,
which is smaller than this value in almost all cases.

.PP
Additionally, several constants are defined to simplify work with raw DNS
packets, such as DNS response codes (\fBDNS_R_\fIXXX\fR), DNS header layout
(\fBDNS_H_\fIXXX\fR) and others.  Again, see udns.h for complete list.
Library error codes (\fBDNS_E_\fIXXX\fR) are described later in this
manual page.

.SH "RESOLVER CONTEXT"

.PP
Resolver context, of type \fBstruct\ dns_ctx\fR, is an object which is
opaque to an application.  Several routines provided by the library
to initialize, copy and free resolver contexts.  Most other high-level
routines in this library expects a pointer to resolver context, \fIctx\fR,
as the first argument.  There is a default resolver context available,
named \fBdns_defctx\fR.  When the context pointer \fIctx\fR passed to
a routine is NULL, \fBdns_defctx\fR is used.  Several resolver contexts
may be active at the same time, for example, when an application is
multi-threaded and each thread uses resolver.
.PP
In order to use the library, an application should initialize and open
one or more resolver context objects.  These are two separate actions,
performed by \fBdns_init\fR() (or \fBdns_reset\fR()), and \fBdns_open\fR().
Between the two calls, an application is free to pefrorm additional
initialisation, such as setting custom nameservers, options or domain search
lists.  Optionally, in case no additional custom initialisation is required,
\fBdns_init\fR() may open the context if \fIdo_open\fR argument (see below)
is non-zero.
.PP
When initializing resolver context, the library uses information from
system file /etc/resolv.conf (see \fBresolv.conf\fR(5)), consults
environment variables \fB$LOCALDOMAIN\fR, \fB$DNSCACHEIP\fR,
\fB$NAMESERVERS\fR and \fB$RES_OPTIONS\fR, and local host name to obtain
list of local nameservers, domain name search list and various resolver
options.
.PP
The following routines to initialize resolver context are available:
.PP
.nf
void \fBdns_reset\fR(\fIctx\fR)
int \fBdns_init\fR(\fIctx\fR, int \fIdo_open\fR)
.fi
.RS
\fBdns_reset\fR() resets a given resolver context to default values,
preparing it to be opened by \fBdns_open\fR().
It is ok to call this routine against opened and active context - all active
queries will be dropped, sockets will be closed and so on.  This routine
does not initialize any parameters from system configuration files, use
\fBdns_init\fR() for this.  There's no error return - operation always
succeeds.  \fBdns_init\fR() does everything \fBdns_reset\fR() does,
plus initializes various parameters of the context according to system
configuration and process environment variables.  If \fIdo_open\fR is
non-zero, \fBdns_init\fR() calls \fIdns_open\fR(), so that the whole
library initialisation is performed in a single step.
.RE
.PP
.nf
struct dns_ctx *\fBdns_new\fR(struct dns_ctx *\fIcopy\fR)
void \fBdns_free\fR(\fIctx\fR)
.fi
.RS
\fBdns_new\fR() allocates new resolver context and copies all parameters
for a given resolver context \fIcopy\fR, or default context if \fIcopy\fR
is NULL, and returns pointer to the newly allocated context.  The context
being copied should be initialized.
\fBdns_new\fR() may fail if there's no memory available to make a copy
of \fIcopy\fR, in which case the routine will return NULL pointer.
\fBdns_free\fR() is used to close assotiated socket and free resolver
context resources and cancelling (abandoming) all active queries
assotiated with it.  It's an error to free \fBdns_defctx\fR, only
dynamically allocated contexts returned by \fBdns_new\fR() are allowed
to be freed by \fBdns_free\fR().

Add an element to list of nameservers (\fBdns_add_serv\fR(), as
asciiz-string \fIservaddr\fR with an IP address of the nameserver,
and \fBdns_add_serv_s\fR(), as initialized socket address \fIsa\fR),
or search list (\fBdns_add_srch\fR(), as a pointer to domain name)
for the given context \fIctx\fR.  If the last argument is a NULL
pointer, the corresponding list (search or nameserver) is reset
instead.  Upon successeful completion, each routine returns new
number of elements in the list in question.  On error, negative
value is returned and global variable \fBerrno\fR is set appropriately.
It is an error to call any of this functions if the context is
opened (after \fBdns_open\fR() or \fBdns_init\fR() with non-zero argument).

opened using this routine.  And before opening, the context should be
initialized.
\fBdns_sock\fR() return the UDP socket if open, or -1 if not.
\fBdns_close\fR() closes the UDP socket if it was open, and drops all active

interface, this is the query completion status of the last query.
With asyncronous interface, from within the callback routine,
this is the query completion status of the query for which the

is the error code indicating failure reason.  All error codes

this routine may be called by an application to process I/O
events on the UDP socket used by the library, as returned
by \fBdns_sock\fR().  The routine tries to receive incoming
UDP datagram from the socket and process it.  The socket is
set up to be non-blocking, so it is safe to call the routine
even if there's no data to read.  The routine will process
as many datagrams as are queued for the socket, so it is
safe to use it with either level-triggered or edge-triggered
I/O monitoring model.  The \fInow\fR argument is either a
current time as returned by \fBtime\fR(), or 0, in which
case the routine will obtain current time by it's own.

from current time (\fInow\fR if it is not 0) to the time when
the library wants the application to pass it control to process
more queued requests.  In case when there are no requests pending,
this time is -1.  The routine will not request a time larger than
\fImaxwait\fR secounds if it is greather or equal to zero.  If
\fInow\fR is 0, the routine will obtain current time by it's own;
when it is not 0, it should contain current time as returned by

.RS
An application may use custom callback-based I/O multiplexing mechanism.
Usually such a mechanism have concept of a \fItimer\fR, and an ability
to register a timer event in a form of a callback routine which will
be executed after certain amount of time.  In order to use such an
event mechanism, udns provides an ability to register and de-register
timer events necessary for internal processing using whatever event
mechanism an application uses.  For this to work, it is possible to
assotiate a pointer to a routine that will perform necessary work for
(de)registering timer events with a given resolver context, and
udns will call that routine at appropriate times.  Prototype of
such a routine is shown by \fBdns_utm_fn\fR typedef above.  Libudns
assotiates single timer with resolver context.  User-supplied \fIutmfn\fR
routine will be called by the library with the following arguments:
.IP "\fIctx\fR == NULL"
delete user timer, at context free time or when an application changes
user timer request routine using \fBdns_set_cbck\fR();
.IP "\fIctx\fR != NULL, \fItimeout\fR < 0"
don't fire timer anymore, when there are no active requests;
.IP "\fIctx\fR != NULL, \fItimeout\fR == 0"
fire timer at the next possibility, but not immediately;
.IP "\fIctx\fR != NULL, \fItimeout\fR > 0"
fire timer after \fItimeout\fR seconds after now.
.PP
The \fIdata\fR argument passed to the routine will be the same
as passed to \fBdns_set_cbck\fR().
.PP
When a timer expires, an application should call \fBdns_tmeouts\fR()
routine (see below).  Non-callback timer usage is provided too.
.RE

.PP
.B XXXX TODO: some more resolver context routines, like dns_set_dbgfn() etc.

.SH "QUERY INTERFACE"

.PP
There are two ways to perform DNS queries: traditional syncronous
way, when udns performs all the necessary processing and return
control to the application only when the query completes, and
asyncronous way, when an application submits one or more queries
to the library using given resolver context, and waits for completion
by monitoring filedescriptor used by library and calling library
routines to process input on that filedescriptor.  Asyncronous mode
works with callback routines: an application supplies an address of
a routine to execute when the query completes, and a data pointer,
which is passed to the callback routine.

.PP
Queries are submitted to the library in a form of \fBstruct\ dns_query\fR.
To perform asyncronous query, an application calls one of the
\fBdns_submit_\fIXXX\fR() rounines, and provides necessary information
for a callback, together with all the query parameters.
When the query completes, library will call application-supplied callback
routine, giving it the resolver context (wich holds query completion status),
dynamically allocated result (which will be either raw DNS packet or, if
applicatin requested parsing the result by specifying non-NULL parse routine,
ready-to-use type-specific structure), and a data pointer provided by an
application when it submitted the query.  It is the application who's
responsible for freeing the result memory.
.PP
Generic query callback routine looks like this:
.nf
typedef void
\fBdns_query_fn\fR(\fIctx\fR, void *\fIresult\fR, void *\fIdata\fR)
.fi
Type-specific query interface expects similar form of callback
routine with the only difference in type of \fBresult\fR argument,
which will be pointer to specific data structure (decoded reply)
instead of this void pointer to raw DNS packet data.

.PP
Result parsing routine looks like this:
.nf
typedef int
\fBdns_parse_fn\fR(const unsigned char *\fIqdn\fR,
      const unsigned char *\fIpkt\fR,
      const unsigned char *\fIcur\fR,
      const unsigned char *\fIend\fR,
      void **\fIresultp\fR);
.fi
When called by the library, the arguments are as follows:
\fIpkt\fR points to the start of the packet received;
\fIend\fR points past the end of the packet received;
\fIcur\fR points past the query DN in the query section of the
packet;
\fIqdn\fR points to the original query DN.
The routine should allocate a single buffer to hold the result,
parse the reply filling in the buffer, and return the buffer
using \fIresultp\fR argument.  It returns 0 in case of error,
or udns error code (\fBDNS_E_\fIXXX\fR constants) in case of
error.
Note that by the time when the parse routine is called by the
library, packet is already verified to be a reply to the
original query, by matching query DN, query class and query type.

.PP
Type-specific query inteface supplies necessary parsing routines
automatically.

.PP
In case of error, query completion status as returned by
\fBdns_status\fR(\fIctx\fR), will contain one of the following values:
.IP "positive value"
length of raw DNS packet if parsing is not requested.
.IP 0
the query was successeful and the \fIreply\fR points to type-specific
data structure.
.IP \fBDNS_E_TEMPFAIL\fR
temporary error, the resolver nameserver was not able to
process our query or timed out.
.IP \fBDNS_E_PROTOCOL\fR
protocol error, a nameserver returned malformed reply.
.IP \fBDNS_E_NXDOMAIN\fR
the domain name does not exist.
.IP \fBDNS_E_NODATA\fR
there is no data of requested type found.
.IP \fBDNS_E_NOMEM\fR
out of memory while processing request.
.IP \fBDNS_E_BADQUERY\fR
some aspect of the query (most common is the domain name in question)
is invalid, and the library can't even start a query.

.PP
Library provides two series of routines which uses similar interface --
one for asyncronous queries and another for syncronous queries.  There
are two general low-level routines in each series to submit (asyncronous
interface) and resolve (syncronous interface) queries, as well as several
type-specific routines with more easy-to-use interfaces.  To submit
an asyncronous query, use one of \fBdns_submit_\fIXXX\fR() routine, each
of which accepts query parameters, pointers to callback routine and to
callback data, and optional current time hint.  Note type-specific
\fBdns_submit_\fIXXX\fR() routines expects specific type of the callback
routine as well, which accepts reply as a pointer to corresponding
structure, not a void pointer).  Every \fBdns_submit_\fIXXX\fR() routine
return pointer to internal query structure of type struct\ dns_query,
used as an identifier for the given query.

.PP
To resolve a query syncronously, use one of \fBdns_resolve_\fIXXX\fR()
routines, which accepts the same query parameters (but not the
callback pointers) as corresponding \fBdns_submit_\fIXXX\fR(), and
return the query result, which is the same as passed to the callback
routine in case of asyncronous interface.

.PP
In either case, the result memory (if the query completed successefully)
is dynamically allocated and should be freed by an application.  If
the query failed for any reason, the result will be NULL, and error
status will be available from \fBdns_status\fR(\fIctx\fR) routine
as shown above.

using option bits in \fIflags\fR, using RR parsing routine pointed by
\fIparse\fR if not-NULL, and upon completion, \fIcbck\fR function will
be called with the \fIdata\fR argument.
In case of successeful query submission,
the routine return pointer to internal query structure which may be treated
as an identifier of the query as used by the library, and may be used as an
argument for \fBdns_cancel\fR() routine.  In case of error, NULL will be
returned, and context error status (available using \fIdns_status\fR() routine)
will be set to corresponding error code, which in this case may be
DNS_E_BADQUERY if the \fIname\fR of \fIdn\fR is invalid, DNS_E_NOMEM if
there's no memory available to allocate query structure, or DNS_E_TEMPFAIL

.SH "TYPE-SPECIFIC QUERIES"

.PP
In addition to the generic low-level query interface, the library provides
a set of routines to perform specific queries in a type-safe manner, as
well as parsers for several well-known resource record types.  The library
implements high-level interface for A, AAAA, PTR, MX and TXT records
and DNSBL and RHSBL functionality.  These routines returns specific types
as result of a query, instead of raw DNS packets.  The following types
and routines are available.

.PP
.nf
struct \fBdns_rr_null\fR {
  char *\fBdnsn_qname\fR;     /* original query name */

It holds information about the packet being parsed (dnsp_pkt, dnsp_end and

the information about specific RR which we're looking for (dnsp_qdn,
dnsp_qcls and dnsp_qtyp fields).

initializes the RR parsing structure \fIp\fR.  Arguments \fIpkt\fR, \fIcur\fR
and \fIend\fR should describe the received packet: \fIpkt\fR is the start of
the packet, \fIend\fR points to the next byte after the end of the packet,
and \fIcur\fR points past the query DN in query section (to query class+type
information).  And \fIqdn\fR points to the query DN.  This is the arguments
passed to \fBdns_parse_fn\fR() routine. \fBdns_initparse\fR() initializes
\fBdnsp_pkt\fR, \fBdnsp_end\fR and \fBdnsp_qdn\fR fields to the corresponding
arguments, extracts and initializes \fBdnsp_qcls\fR and \fBdnsp_qtyp\fR

.RS
searches for next RR in the packet based on the criteria provided in
the \fIp\fR structure, filling in the \fIrr\fR structure and
advancing \fIp\fR->\fBdnsp_cur\fR to the next RR in the packet.
RR selection is based on dnsp_qdn, dnsp_qcls and dnsp_qtyp fields in
the dns_parse structure.  Any (or all) of the 3 fields may be 0,
which means any actual value from the packet is acceptable.  In case
the field isn't 0 (or NULL for dnsp_qdn), only RRs with corresponding
characteristics are acceptable.  Additionally, when dnsp_qdn is non-NULL,
\fBdns_nextrr\fR() performs automatic CNAME expansion.
Routine will return positive value on success, 0 in case it reached the end
of current section in the packet (\fIp\fR->\fBdnsp_rrl\fR is zero), or
negative value if next RR can not be decoded (packet format is invalid).
The routine updates \fIp\fR->\fBdnsp_qdn\fR automatically when this
field is non-NULL and it encounters appropriate CNAME RRs (saving CNAME
target in \fIp\fR->\fBdnsp_dnbuf\fR), so after end of the process,
\fIp\fR->\fBdnsp_qdn\fR will point to canonical name of the domain
in question.  The routine updates \fIp\fR->\fBdnsp_ttl\fR value to
be the minimum TTL of all RRs found.
