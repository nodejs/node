  Regression from c-ares 1.19.1, ARES_OPT_UDP_PORT and ARES_OPT_TCP_PORT are
  specified from the user in host-byte order, but there was a regression that
  caused it to be read as if it was network byte order.

  Basic Thread Safety (#636)
  
  c-ares does not have any concept of thread-safety. It has always been 100% up to the implementor to ensure they never call c-ares from more than one thread at a time. This patch adds basic thread-safety support, which can be disabled at compile time if not desired. It uses a single recursive mutex per channel, which should be extremely quick when uncontested so overhead should be minimal.
  
  Fixes Bug: #610
  
  Also sets the stage to implement #611

  ares_getaddrinfo(): do not use search domains if ARES_FLAG_NOSEARCH is set (#638)
  
  c-ares init options defines a flag ARES_FLAG_NOSEARCH that is supposed to prevent search using configured domain suffixes, however when using ares_getaddrinfo() the flag was ignored and domain suffixes were used anyway.
  
  Configuring zero domains to search also does not work (if ndomains == 0 default domain search list is loaded regardless of the flag ARES_OPT_DOMAINS being set).
  
  This change adds a check for the ARES_FLAG_NOSEARCH in as_is_only() function that is used by ares_getaddrinfo() to decide if to try to query next possible name ( next_dns_lookup() )

- ares_set_servers_*() should allow an empty server list
  
  For historic reasons, we have users depending on ares_set_servers_*()
  to return ARES_SUCCESS when passing no servers and actually *clear*
  the server list.  It appears they do this for test cases to simulate
  DNS unavailable or similar.  Presumably they could achieve the same
  effect in other ways (point to localhost on a port that isn't in use).
  But it seems like this might be wide-spread enough to cause headaches
  so we just will document and test for this behavior, clearly it hasn't
  caused "issues" for anyone with the old behavior.

  Query Cache support (#625)
  
  This PR implements a query cache at the lowest possible level, the actual dns request and response messages.  Only successful and `NXDOMAIN` responses are cached. The lowest TTL in the response message determines the cache validity period for the response, and is capped at the configuration value for `qcache_max_ttl`.  For `NXDOMAIN` responses, the SOA record is evaluated.
  
  For a query to match the cache, the opcode, flags, and each question's class, type, and name are all evaluated.  This is to prevent matching a cached entry for a subtly different query (such as if the RD flag is set on one request and not another).
  
  For things like ares_getaddrinfo() or ares_search() that may spawn multiple queries, each individual message received is cached rather than the overarching response.  This makes it possible for one query in the sequence to be purged from the cache while others still return cached results which means there is no chance of ever returning stale data.
  
  We have had a lot of user requests to return TTLs on all the various parsers like `ares_parse_caa_reply()`, and likely this is because they want to implement caching mechanisms of their own, thus this PR should solve those issues as well.
  
  Due to the internal data structures we have these days, this PR is less than 500 lines of new code.

- ares__htable_strvp should be case-insensitive

- optimize: large /etc/hosts files reading
  
  profiling found some hot paths that could be optimized to reduce
  insert times into the cache.
  
  Fix By: Brad House (@bradh352)

- Fix /etc/hosts processing performance with all entries using same IP address
  
  Some users use blacklist files like https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts which
  can contain 200k+ host entries all pointing to 0.0.0.0.  Due to the merge
  logic in the new hosts processor, all those entries will be associated as
  aliases for the same ip address.
  
  The first issue is that it attempts to check the status of all the hosts for
  the merged entry, when it should only be checking the new hosts added to the
  merged entry, so this caused exponential time as the entries got longer.
  
  The next issue is if searching for one of those hosts, it would append all
  the matches as cnames/aliases, but there is zero use for 200k aliases
  being appended to a lookup, so we are artificially capping this to 100.

  Randomize retry penalties to prevent thundering herd type issues (#606)
  
  The retry timeout values were using a fixed calculation which could cause multiple simultaneous queries to timeout and retry at the exact same time.  If a DNS server is throttling requests, this could cause the issue to never self-resolve due to all requests recurring at the same instance again.
  
  This PR also creates a maximum timeout option to make sure the random value selected does not exceed this value.

  This PR implements ares_reinit() to safely reload a channel's configuration even if there are existing queries.  This function can be called when system configuration is detected to be changed, however since c-ares isn't thread aware, care must be taken to ensure no other c-ares calls are in progress at the time this function is called.  Also, this function may update the open file descriptor list so care must also be taken to wake any event loops and reprocess the list of file descriptors.

  rewrite adig using new helpers (#607)
  
  adig previously performed manual parsing of the DNS records.  Now it can focus strictly on formatting of output data for printing.  It simply iterates across the parsed DNS packet and queries for the RRs, parameters for each RR, and the datatypes for each parameter.  adig will now automatically pick up new RRs from the c-ares library due to the dynamic nature.
  
  The adig format also now more closely resembles that of BIND's `dig` output.
  
  A few more helpers needed to be added to the c-ares library that were missing.  There ware a couple of minor bugs and enhancements also needed.
  
  Example:
  ```

  make dns parser/writer public (#604)
  
  This PR makes the c-ares parser introduced in 1.21, and the new writer, along with associated helpers public.  These helpers are contained in a new public header of `ares_dns_record.h` which should _**not**_ be included directly, instead simply including `ares.h` is sufficient.  This will address #587, as well as #470.
  
  A follow-up PR will be made which will transform `adig` to use the new parsers and helpers.
  
  This PR does not currently add man pages for these public functions, that will be in a follow-up PR once the `adig` migration is done which may expose additional needed helpers.
  
  The two aforementioned PRs will be done before the 1.22 release.

  OPT RR should support parsing key/value options (#602)
  
  The OPT RR record has some seldom used options with a 16bit key and a binary value.  The current parser and writer was not supporting this.  This PR adds support.  The same format is also used for SVCB/HTTPS records, so getting this in there is necessary to support that RR type.
  
  Also, we split the Binary record format into BIN and BINP, where BINP is an indicator that the binary data is _likely_ printable and will guarantee a NULL terminator.  This is helpful for those attempting to print RRs.

  DNS Record Write (#598)
  
  The `ares_dns_record_t` data structure created in the prior release is capable of holding a complete parsed DNS message and also provides all helpers in order to fill in the data structure.  This PR adds write capabilities for this data structure to form a complete message and supports features such as DNS name compression as defined in RFC1035.  Though this message writing capability goes further than c-ares internally needs, external users may find it useful ... and we may find it useful for test validation as well.
  
  This also replaces the existing message writing code in `ares_create_query()`, as well rewriting the request message without EDNS in ares_process.c's `process_answer()`.

  `ares_channel` -> `ares_channel_t *`: don't bury the pointer (#595)
  
  `ares_channel` is defined as `typedef struct ares_channeldata *ares_channel;`.  The problem with this, is it embeds the pointer into the typedef, which means an `ares_channel` can never be declared as `const` as if you write `const ares_channel channel`, that expands to `struct ares_channeldata * const ares_channel` and not `const struct ares_channeldata *channel`.
  
  We will now typedef `ares_channel_t` as `typedef struct ares_channeldata ares_channel_t;`, so if you write `const ares_channel_t *channel`, it properly expands to `const struct ares_channeldata *channel`.
  
  We are maintaining the old typedef for API compatibility with existing integrations, and due to typedef expansion this should not even cause any compiler warnings for existing code.  There are no ABI implications with this change.  I could be convinced to keep existing public functions as `ares_channel` if a sufficient argument exists, but internally we really need make this change for modern best practices.
  
  This change will allow us to internally use `const ares_channel_t *` where appropriate.  Whether or not we decide to change any public interfaces to use `const` may require further discussion on if there might be ABI implications (I don't think so, but I'm also not 100% sure what a compiler internally does with `const` when emitting machine code ... I think more likely ABI implications would occur going the opposite direction).
  
  FYI, This PR was done via a combination of sed and clang-format, the only manual code change was the addition of the new typedef, and a couple doc fixes :)

  Dynamic Server List (#594)
  
  This PR makes the server list a dynamic sorted list of servers. The sort order is [ consecutive failures, system config index ]. The server list can be updated via ares_set_servers_*(). Any queries currently directed to servers that are no longer in the list will be automatically re-queued to a different server.
  
  Also, any time a failure occurs on the server, the sort order of the servers will be updated so that the one with the fewest consecutive failures is chosen for the next query that goes on the wire, this way bad or non-responsive servers are automatically isolated.
  
  Since the server list is now dynamic, the tracking of query failures per server has been removed and instead is relying on the server sort order as previously described. This simplifies the logic while also reducing the amount of memory required per query. However, because of this dynamic nature, it may not be easy to determine the server attempt order for enqueued queries if there have been any failures.
  
  If using the ARES_OPT_ROTATE, this is now implemented to be a random selection of the configured servers. Since the server list is dynamic, its not possible to go to the next server as configuration could have changed between queries or attempts for the same query.
  
  Finally, this PR moved some existing functions into new files to logically separate them.
  
  This should address issues #550 and #440, while also setting the framework to implement #301. #301 needs a little more effort since it configures things other than the servers themselves (domains, search, sortlist, lookups), which need to make sure they can be safely updated.

  Replace hosts parser, add caching capabilities (#591)
  
  HOSTS FILE PROCESSING OVERVIEW
  ==============================
  The hosts file on the system contains static entries to be processed locally
  rather than querying the nameserver.  Each row is an IP address followed by
  a list of space delimited hostnames that match the ip address.  This is used
  for both forward and reverse lookups.
  
  We are caching the entire parsed hosts file for performance reasons.  Some
  files may be quite sizable and as per Issue #458 can approach 1/2MB in size,
  and the parse overhead on a rapid succession of queries can be quite large.
  The entries are stored in forwards and backwards hashtables so we can get
  O(1) performance on lookup.  The file is cached until the file modification
  timestamp changes (or 60s if there is no implemented stat() capability).
  
  The hosts file processing is quite unique. It has to merge all related hosts
  and ips into a single entry due to file formatting requirements.  For
  instance take the below:
  ```
  127.0.0.1    localhost.localdomain localhost
  ::1          localhost.localdomain localhost
  192.168.1.1  host.example.com host
  192.168.1.5  host.example.com host
  2620:1234::1 host.example.com host6.example.com host6 host
  ```
  This will yield 2 entries.
  1) ips: `127.0.0.1,::1`
      hosts: `localhost.localdomain,localhost`
  2) ips: `192.168.1.1,192.168.1.5,2620:1234::1`
      hosts: `host.example.com,host,host6.example.com,host6`
  
  It could be argued that if searching for `192.168.1.1` that the `host6`
  hostnames should not be returned, but this implementation will return them
  since they are related (both ips have the fqdn of host.example.com).  It is
  unlikely this will matter in the real world.

  Modernization: replace multiple hand-parsers with new memory-safe parser (#581)
  
  New DNS record parsing code. The old code was basically just some helper macros and functions for parsing an entire DNS message. The caller had to know the RFCs to use the parsers, except for some pre-made exceptions. The new parsing code parses the entire DNS message into an opaque data structure in a memory safe manner with various accessors for reading and manipulating the data.
  
  The existing parser helpers for the various record types were reimplemented as wrappers around the new parser.
  
  The accessors allow easy iteration across the DNS record datastructure, and can be used to easily create dig-like output without needing to know anything about the various record types and formats as dynamic helpers are provided for enumeration of values and data types of those values.
  
  At some point in the future, this new DNS record structure, accessors, and parser will be exposed publicly. This is not done at this point as we don't want to do that until the API is completely stable. Likely a write() function to output the DNS record back into an actual message buffer will be introduced with the stable API as well.
  
  Some subtle bugs in the existing code were uncovered, some which had test cases which turned out to be bogus. Validation with third-party implementations (e.g. BIND9) were performed to validate such cases were indeed bugs.
  
  Adding additional RR parsers such as for TLSA (#470) or SVCB/HTTPS (#566) are trivial now since focus can be put on only parsing the data within the RR, not the entire message. That said, as the new parser is not yet public, it isn't clear the best way to expose any new RRs (probably best to wait for the new parser to be public rather than hacking in another legacy function).
  
  Some additional RRs that are part of DNS RFC1035 or EDNS RFC6891 that didn't have previously implemented parsers are now also implemented (e.g. HINFO, OPT). Any unrecognized RRs are encapsulated into a "RAW_RR" as binary data which can be inserted or extracted, but are otherwise not interpreted in any way.

  introduce ares_bool_t datatype (#570)
  
  c-ares currently uses int for boolean, which can be confusing as there are some functions which return int but use '0' as the success condition. Some internal variable usage is similar. Lets try to identify the boolean use cases and split them out into their own data type of ares_bool_t. Since we're trying to keep C89 compatibility, we can't rely on stdbool.h or the _Bool C99 data type, so we'll define our own.
  
  Also, chose using an enum rather than say unsigned char or int because of the type safety benefits it provides. Compilers should warn if you try to pass, ARES_TRUE on to a ares_status_t enum (or similar) since they are different enums.

  ares_status_t enum for status codes (#567)
  
  The list of possible error codes in c-ares was a #define list. This not only doesn't provide for any sort of type safety but it also lacks clarification on what a function may return or what it takes, as an int could be an ares status, a boolean, or possibly even a length in the current code.
  
  We are not changing any public APIs as though the C standard states the underlying size and type of an enum is int, there are compiler attributes to override this as well as compiler flags like -fshort-enums. GCC in particular is known to expand an enum's width based on the data values (e.g., it can emit a 64bit integer enum).
  
  All internal usages should be changed by this PR, but of course, there may be some I missed.

  I've started creating a basic parser/buffer framework for c-ares for memory safety reasons, but it also helps for things like this where we shouldn't be manually tracking positions and fetching only a couple of bytes at a time from a socket. This parser/buffer will be expanded and used more in the future.

  ares_getaddrinfo(): Fail faster on AF_UNSPEC if we've already received one address class  (#551)

  This will limit the overall query time to whatever timeout remains for the pending query for the other address class, it will not, however, terminate the other query as it may still prove to be successful (possibly coming in less than a millisecond later) and we'd want that result still. It just turns off additional error processing to get the result back quicker.

  Configuration option to limit number of UDP queries per ephemeral port (#549)
  
  Add a new ARES_OPT_UDP_MAX_QUERIES option with udp_max_queries parameter that can be passed to ares_init_options(). This value defaults to 0 (unlimited) to maintain existing compatibility, any positive number will cause new UDP ephemeral ports to be created once the threshold is reached, we'll call these 'connections' even though its technically wrong for UDP.
  
  Implementation Details:
  * Each server entry in a channel now has a linked-list of connections/ports for udp and tcp. The first connection in the list is the one most likely to be eligible to accept new queries.
  * Queries are now tracked by connection rather than by server.
  * Every time a query is detached from a connection, the connection that it was attached to will be checked to see if it needs to be cleaned up.
  * Insertion, lookup, and searching for connections has been implemented as O(1) complexity so the number of connections will not impact performance.
  * Remove is_broken from the server, it appears it would be set and immediately unset, so must have been invalidated via a prior patch. A future patch should probably track consecutive server errors and de-prioritize such servers. The code right now will always try servers in the order of configuration, so a bad server in the list will always be tried and may rely on timeout logic to try the next.
  * Various other cleanups to remove code duplication and for clarification.

  Modernization: Implement base data-structures and replace usage (#540)
  
  c-ares currently lacks modern data structures that can make coding easier and more efficient. This PR implements a new linked list, skip list (sorted linked list), and hashtable implementation that are easy to use and hard to misuse. Though these implementations use more memory allocations than the prior implementation, the ability to more rapidly iterate on the codebase is a bigger win than any marginal performance difference (which is unlikely to be visible, modern systems are much more powerful than when c-ares was initially created).
  
  The data structure implementation favors readability and audit-ability over performance, however using the algorithmically correct data type for the purpose should offset any perceived losses.
  
  The primary motivation for this PR is to facilitate future implementation for Issues #444, #135, #458, and possibly #301
  
  A couple additional notes:
  
  The ares_timeout() function is now O(1) complexity instead of O(n) due to the use of a skiplist.
  Some obscure bugs were uncovered which were actually being incorrectly validated in the test cases. These have been addressed in this PR but are not explicitly discussed.

  Add str len check in config_sortlist to avoid stack overflow (#497)
  
  In ares_set_sortlist, it calls config_sortlist(..., sortstr) to parse
  the input str and initialize a sortlist configuration.
  
  However, ares_set_sortlist has not any checks about the validity of the input str.
  It is very easy to create an arbitrary length stack overflow with the unchecked
  `memcpy(ipbuf, str, q-str);` and `memcpy(ipbufpfx, str, q-str);`
  statements in the config_sortlist call, which could potentially cause severe
  security impact in practical programs.
  
  This commit add necessary check for `ipbuf` and `ipbufpfx` which avoid the
  potential stack overflows.

  bug fix: new ares_strsplit (#492)
  
  * add ares_strsplit unit test
  
  The test reveals a bug in the implementation of ares_strsplit when the
  make_set parameter is set to 1, as distinct domains are confused for
  equal:
  
    out = ares_strsplit("example.com, example.co", ", ", 1, &n);
  
  evaluates to n = 1 with out = { "example.com" }.
  
  * bugfix and cleanup of ares_strsplit
  
  The purpose of ares_strsplit in c-ares is to split a comma-delimited
  string of unique (up to letter case) domains. However, because the
  terminating NUL byte was not checked in the substrings when comparing
  for uniqueness, the function would sometimes drop domains it should
  not. For example,
  
      ares_strsplit("example.com, example.co", ",")
  
  would only result in a single domain "example.com".
  
  Aside from this bugfix, the following cleanup is performed:
  
  1. The tokenization now happens with the help of strcspn instead of the
     custom function is_delim.
  2. The function list_contains has been inlined.
  3. The interface of ares_strsplit has been simplified by removing the
     parameter make_set since in practice it was always 1.
  4. There are fewer passes over the input string.
  5. We resize the table using realloc() down to its minimum size.
  6. The docstring of ares_strsplit is updated and also a couple typos
     are fixed.
  
  There occurs a single use of ares_strsplit and since the make_set
  parameter has been removed, the call in ares_init.c is modified
  accordingly. The unit test for ares_strsplit is also updated.

  Windows: rework/simplify initialization code, drop long EOL systems (#445)
  
  There was a lot of windows initialization code specific to the era that predates Windows Vista such as reading DNS configuration from the registry, and dynamically loading libraries to get access to functions that didn't exist in XP or earlier releases.
  
  Vista was released in January 2007, and was EOL'd in 2017, and support for Vista is still maintained with this patch set.
  
  XP was EOL'd in Apr 8 2014.
  
  I believe the last OS based on something earlier than Vista was POSReady 2009, as it was XP based for some reason, and that was EOL'd in January 2019. Considering any POS system falls under the PCI-DSS rules, they aren't allow to run POSReady 2009 any more so there is no reason to try to continue supporting such systems.
  
  We have also targeted with our build system Vista support for the last few years, and while developers could change the target, we haven't had any reports that they have.

  Reimplement ares_gethostbyname() by wrapping ares_getaddrinfo() (#428)
  
  ares_gethostbyname() and ares_getaddrinfo() do a lot of similar things, however ares_getaddrinfo() has some desirable behaviors that should be imported into ares_gethostbyname(). For one, it sorts the address lists for the most likely to succeed based on the current system routes. Next, when AF_UNSPEC is specified, it properly handles search lists instead of first searching all of AF_INET6 then AF_INET, since ares_gethostbyname() searches in parallel. Therefore, this PR should also resolve the issues attempted in #94.
  
  A few things this PR does:
  
  1. ares_parse_a_reply() and ares_parse_aaaa_reply() had very similar code to translate struct ares_addrinfo into a struct hostent as well as into struct ares_addrttl/ares_addr6ttl this has been split out into helper functions of ares__addrinfo2hostent() and ares__addrinfo2addrttl() to prevent this duplicative code.
  
  2. ares_getaddrinfo() was apparently never honoring HOSTALIASES, and this was discovered once ares_gethostbyname() was turned into a wrapper, the affected test cases started failing.
  
  3. A slight API modification to save the query hostname into struct ares_addrinfo as the last element of name. Since this is the last element, and all user-level instances of struct ares_addrinfo are allocated internally by c-ares, this is not an ABI-breaking change nor would it impact any API compatibility. This was needed since struct hostent has an h_name element.
  
  4. Test Framework: MockServer tests via TCP would fail if more than 1 request was received at a time which is common when ares_getaddrinfo() queries for both A and AAAA records simultaneously. Infact, this was a long standing issue in which the ares_getaddrinfo() test were bypassing TCP alltogether. This has been corrected, the message is now processed in a loop.
  
  5. Some tests had to be updated for overall correctness as they were invalid but somehow passing prior to this change.

  Bugfix/crash in ares  sortaddrinfo (#400)
  
  The bug was generated because there was no check for the number
  of items in the list and invalid memory was accesed when the list
  was empty. There is a check for null after calling malloc but on
  some systems it always returns a valid address for size equals 0.
  Relates To: #392, 0903dcecabca283d0fa771632892dc7592b7a66d

- Null deref if ares_getaddrinfo() is terminated with ares_destroy()
  
  ares_freeaddrinfo() was not checking for a Null ptr during cleanup of
  an aborted query.
  
  Once that was resolved it uncovered another possible issue with
  multiple simultaneous underlying queries being outstanding and
  possibly prematurely cleaning up the handle.

  RANDOM_FILE was never defined by cmake, causing RC4 key generation to use the less secure rand() method.
  
  Also, due to clashes with chain-building from other projects (e.g. curl) that may define RANDOM_FILE, this was renamed to CARES_RANDOM_FILE.

- ares_parse_ptr_reply() handle NULL for addr/addr_len. Fixes #392
  
  NodeJS passes NULL for addr and 0 for addrlen parameters to ares_parse_ptr_reply().  On systems where malloc(0) returned NULL, this would cause the function to return ARES_ENOMEM, but the cleanup wasn't handled properly and would crash.
  
  This patche fixes that bug, and also hardens ares_free_hostent() to not leak memory during cleanup.

  Tests should use dynamic system-assigned ports rather than static port (#346)
  
  The c-ares test suite was hardcoded to use port 5300 (and possibly 5301, 5302) for the test suite.  Especially in containers, there may be no guarantee these ports are available and cause tests to fail when they could otherwise succeed.  Instead, request the system to assign a port to use dynamically.  This is now the default.  To override, the test suite still takes the "-p <port>" option as it always has and will honor that.

  The basic idea of sticking to RFC that a ns_t_any too should return an SOA record is something open for discussion but I have kept the functionality intact as it was previously i.e the function returns ARES_EBADRESP if it doesn't find a SOA record regardless of which response it is parsing i.e. T_SOA or T_ANY.
  
  Note that asking for T_ANY is generally a bad idea:

  Apply the IPv6 server blacklist to all nameserver sources, not just Windows (#193)
  
  For #164, I mentioned that it seemed like the IPv6 nameserver blacklist should apply to all OSes. In a mailing list post, @bradh352 agreed and suggested that I file a PR to make it so.
  
  This moves the blacklist check from being Windows-specific to being a general feature of config_nameservers(), no matter the nameserver source. It also simplifies the ares_ipv6_server_blacklisted() implementation to not parse and re-parse the blacklisted IPv6 addresses from strings on every check. I think they're almost as easy to read as a sequence of hex bytes in an array initializer, and it's definitely less work on each trip through the code.

  Fix warnings emitted by MSVC when using -W4 (#192)
  
  These changes fix a few warnings emitted by recent versions of MSVC when compiling with -W4. Half of the changes are in Windows-specific code, and the other half should be safe no matter the compiler or OS.
  
  The allocation function change is probably the only one that needs explanation. MSVC gives warnings about the function pointers not being stable across DLL boundaries or something to that effect, so for Windows, I've made them be called indirectly, which at least made the compiler happy. I can't say I've tested every linking combination on Windows with them before or after the change, but it seems harmless.

  Harden and rationalize c-ares timeout computation (#187)
  
  * Harden and rationalize c-ares timeout computation
  * Remove the rand() part of the timeout calculation completely.
  
  When c-ares sends a DNS query, it computes the timeout for that request as follows:
  
  timeplus = channel->timeout << (query->try_count / channel->nservers);
  timeplus = (timeplus * (9 + (rand () & 7))) / 16;
  I see two issues with this code. Firstly, when either try_count or channel->timeout are large enough, this can end up as an illegal shift.
  
  Secondly, the algorithm for adding the random timeout (added in 2009) is surprising. The original commit that introduced this algorithm says it was done to avoid a "packet storm". But, the algorithm appears to only reduce the timeout by an amount proportional to the scaled timeout's magnitude. It isn't clear to me that, for example, cutting a 30 second timeout almost in half to roughly 17 seconds is appropriate. Even with the default timeout of 5000 ms, this algorithm computes values between 2812 ms and 5000 ms, which is enough to cause a slightly latent DNS response to get spuriously dropped.
  
  If preventing the timers from all expiring at the same time really is desirable, then it seems better to extend the timeout by a small factor so that the application gets at least the timeout it asked for, and maybe a little more. In my experience, this is common practice for timeouts: applications expect that a timeout will happen at or after the designated time (but not before), allowing for delay in detecting and reporting the timeout. Furthermore, it seems like the timeout shouldn't be extended by very much (we don't want a 30 second timeout changing into a 45 second timeout, either).
  
  Consider also the documentation of channel->timeout in ares_init_options():
  
  The number of milliseconds each name server is given to respond to a query on the first try. (After the first try, the timeout algorithm becomes more complicated, but scales linearly with the value of timeout.) The default is five seconds.
  
  In the current implementation, even the first try does not use the value that the user supplies; it will use anywhere between 56% and 100% of that value.
  
  The attached patch attempts to address all of these concerns without trying to make the algorithm much more sophisticated. After performing a safe shift, this patch simply adds a small random timeout to the computed value of between 0 ms and 511 ms. I could see limiting the random amount to be no greater than a proportion of the configured magnitude, but I can't see scaling the random with the overall computed timeout. As far as I understand, the goal is just to schedule retries "not at the same exact time", so a small difference seems sufficient.
  
  UPDATE: randomization removed.

  Fix DNS server lookup breaking with Android O due to Android removing access to net.dns# system properties. (#148)
  
  As of Android 8 (Oreo) access to net.dns# has been removed (https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes.html). The reasoning given is that it, "improves privacy on the platform". Currently c-ares uses this to get the list of DNS servers.
  
  Now the only way to access the DNS server list is by using the Connectivity Manager though Java. This adds the necessary JNI code to use the Connectivity Manager and pull the DNS server list. The old way using __system_property_get with net.dns# remains for compatibilty.
  
  Using the Connectivity Manager requires the ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permission to be set on the app. Existing applications most likely are not setting this and keeping the previous method as a fallback will at the very least ensure those apps don't break on older versions of Android. They will need to add this permission for Android 8 compatibility.
  
  Included in the patch are two initalization functions which are required. The JVM must be registered as well as the Connectivity Manager itself. There is no way to get the Connectivity Manager except though Java. Either being passed down to C directly or by passing in an Android Context which can be used to get the Connectivity Manager. Examples are provided in the documentation.

  gethostbyaddr: fail with `ECANCELLED` for `ares_cancel()`
  
  When `ares_cancel()` was invoked, `ares_gethostbyaddr()`
  queries would fail with `ENOTFOUND` instead of `ECANCELLED`.
  
  It seems appropriate to treat `ares_cancel()` like `ares_destroy()`,
  but I would appreciate review of the correctness of this change.

  ares_parse_naptr_reply: make buffer length check more accurate
  
  9478908a490a6bf009ba58d81de8c1d06d50a117 introduced a length check
  for records parsed by `ares_parse_naptr_reply()`. However, that
  function is designed to parse replies which also contain non-NAPTR
  records; for A records, the `rr_len > 7` check will fail as there
  are only 4 bytes of payload.
  In particular, parsing ANY replies for NAPTR records was broken
  by that patch.
  
  Fix that by moving the check into the case in which it is already
  known that the record is a NAPTR record.

  Windows DNS server sorting (#81)
  
  Original Patch From Brad Spencer:
  https://c-ares.haxx.se/mail/c-ares-archive-2016-04/0000.shtml
  
  My modifications include:
   * Dynamically find GetBestRoute2 since it is a Windows Vista+ symbol, and will fall back to prior behavior when not available.
   * Prefer get_DNS_AdaptersAddresses as the modifications should alleviate the concerns which caused us to prefer get_DNS_NetworkParams
   * Update AppVeyor to use MinGW-w64 instead of the legacy MinGW
   * Fix compile error in test suite for Windows.
  
  Original message from patch below:
  
  From: Brad Spencer <bspencer@blackberry.com>
  Date: Fri, 29 Apr 2016 14:26:23 -0300
  
  On Windows, the c-ares DNS resolver tries first to get a full list of
  DNS server addresses by enumerating the system's IPv4/v6 interfaces and
  then getting the per-interface DNS server lists from those interfaces
  and joining them together. The OS, at least in the way the c-ares
  prefers to query them (which also may be the only or best way in some
  environments), does not provide a unified list of DNS servers ordered
  according to "current network conditions". Currently, c-ares will then
  try to use them in whatever order the nested enumeration produces, which
  may result in DNS requests being sent to servers on one interface
  (hosting the current default route, for example) that are only intended
  to be used via another interface (intended to be used when the first
  interface is not available, for example). This, in turn, can lead to
  spurious failures and timeouts simply because of the server address
  order that resulted because of the enumeration process.
  
  This patch makes the (safe?) assumption that there is no other better
  rule to chose which interface's DNS server list should be prioritized.
  After all, a DNS lookup isn't something "per network"; applications
  don't look up "these DNS names on this interface and those DNS names on
  that interface". There is a single resource pool of DNS servers and the
  application should presume that any server will give it the "right"
  answer. However, even if all DNS servers are assumed to give equally
  useful responses, it is reasonable to expect that some DNS servers will
  not accept requests on all interfaces. This patch avoids the problem by
  sorting the DNS server addresses using the Windows IPv4/v6 routing tables.
  
  For example, a request to DNS server C on interface 2 that is actually
  sent over interface 1 (which may happen to have the default route) may
  be rejected by or not delivered to DNS server C. So, better to use DNS
  servers A and B associated with interface 1, at least as a first try.
  
  By using the metric of the route to the DNS server itself as a proxy for
  priority of the DNS server in the list, this patch is able to adapt
  dynamically to changes in the interface list, the DNS server lists per
  interface, which interfaces are active, the routing table, and so on,
  while always picking a good "best" DNS server first.
  
  In cases where any DNS server on any interface will do, this patch still
  seems useful because it will prioritize a lower-metric route's (and thus
  interface's) servers.

  as in-depth in CMake as they are for autotools ... it is unclear why some
  of them exist at all, I'm guessing for legacy systems that CMake probably
  doesn't support anyhow.

- api: add ARES_OPT_NOROTATE optmask value
  
  Fix up a couple of problems with configuring whether c-ares rotates
  between different name servers between requests.
  
  Firstly, ares_save_options() returns (in *optmask) the value of
  (channel->optmask & ARES_OPT_ROTATE), which doesn't necessarily
  indicate whether the channel is or is not actually doing rotation.
  This can be confusing/incorrect if:
   - the channel was originally configured without ARES_OPT_ROTATE
     (so it appears that the channel is not rotating)
   - the /etc/resolv.conf file includes the 'rotate' option
     (so the channel is actually performing rotation).
  
  Secondly, it is not possible to reliably configure a channel
  to not-rotate; leaving off ARES_OPT_ROTATE is not enough, since
  a 'rotate' option in /etc/resolv.conf will turn it on again.
  
  Therefore:
   - add an ARES_OPT_NOROTATE optmask value to allow explicit
     configuration of no-rotate behaviour
   - in ares_save_options(), report the value of channel->rotate
     as exactly one of (optmask & ARES_OPT_ROTATE) or
     (optmask & ARES_OPT_NOROTATE).
  
  In terms of back-compatibility:
   - existing apps that set ARES_OPT_ROTATE will continue to rotate,
     and to have ARES_OPT_ROTATE reported back from ares_save_options()
   - existing apps that don't set ARES_OPT_ROTATE will continue to
     use local config/defaults to decide whether to rotate, and will
     now get ARES_OPT_ROTATE or ARES_OPT_NOROTATE reported back from
     ares_save_options() rather than 0.

- ares_init_options: only propagate init failures from options
  
  Commit 46bb820be3a8 ("ares_init_options: don't lose init failure")
  changed init behaviour so that earlier errors in initialization
  weren't lost.  In particular, if the user passes in specific
  options but they are not applied (e.g. because of an allocation
  failure), that failure needs to be reported back to the user; this
  also applies when duplicating a channel with ares_dup().
  
  However, other initialization failures can be ignored and
  overridden -- in particular, if init_by_resolv_conf() or
  init_by_environment() fail, then falling back to default values
  is OK.
  
  So only preserve failures from the init_by_options() stage, not
  from all initialization stages.
  
  Fixes issue 60.

- test: fuzzer mode for AFL's persistent mode
  
  When fuzzing with AFL, if the LLVM-based instrumentation is

  have a single execution of the fuzzer program iterate multiple
  times over the fuzzing entrypoint (similar to libFuzzer's normal
  mode of execution) with different data.  This is much (e.g. 10x)
  faster.
  
  Add code to support this, by checking whether __AFL_LOOP is
  defined at compile-time.
  
  Also, shift the code to effectively be C rather than C++.

- test: simplify deps for fuzzer entrypoint
  
  No need to depend on the rest of the test code (ares-test.h) for
  the fuzzer entrypoint; this makes the entrypoint slightly simpler

  Also shift the code to effectively be C rather than C++

  system can support the tests in the first place.  Many (most?) systems
  do not have C++11.  This also causes issues when chain-building c-ares,
  the hosting system needs to be updated to support passing this
  additional flag if necessary, it doesn't seem reasonable to add this
  requirement which breaks compatibility.
  
  This change auto-detects if the system can build the tests and
  automatically disable them if it cannot.  If you pass --enable-tests to
  configure and the system cannot build them either due to lack of system
  support, or because cross-compilation is being used, it will throw an
  appropriate error since the user indicated they really did want the
  tests.

- test: prefer ON_CALL to EXPECT_CALL to reduce flakes
  
  For UDP tests, there's a chance of a retry.  EXPECT_CALL only
  expects a single request to arrive at the server; ON_CALL allows
  for a UDP retry and repeats the same answer.
  
  Note that ON_CALL and EXPECT_CALL can't be mixed in the same
  test, and that tests that have a varied sequence of responses
  for the same repeated request still have to use EXPECT_CALL.

David Drysdale (11 Feb 2016)
- Use "resolve" as synonym of "dns" in nsswitch.conf

  Fixes #33

- ares_set_socket_callback: make manpage match code

  callback only checks for rc < 0, not for standard ares error codes.

  Add ares_set_socket_configure_callback()

- test: Update init tests to match behaviour
  
  Unreadable config files are now treated the same way

- [Fedor Indutny brought this change]

  Ignore `fopen` errors to use default values
  
  After 46bb820be3a83520e70e6c5f0c5133253fcd69cd `init_by_resolv_conf`
  errors are no longer swallowed in `ares_init_options`. This has exposed
  a previously unknown bug in `lookups` initialization code.
  
  If there is no lookup configuration in `resolv.conf`,
  `init_by_resolv_conf` will attempt to read it from other files available
  on the system. However, some of these files may have restricted
  permissions (like `600`), which will lead to `EACCESS` errno, which in
  turn is handled like a fatal error by `init_by_resolv_conf`.
  
  However, it sounds illogical that this error should be handled as a
  fatal. There is a `init_by_defaults` call that overrides `lookups` with
  default value, and certainly possible absence of lookup information is
  the reason why this function exists in a first place!
  
  I suggest handling any `fopen` errors as non-fatal ones, allowing to
  pick up the `lookups` value from different config files, or to pick up
  default value.

Andrew Ayer (9 Feb 2016)
- Document callback type in man page for ares_set_socket_callback

- Add ares_set_socket_configure_callback()
  
  This function sets a callback that is invoked after the socket is

  time to customize various socket options.

  txt: introduce `ares_parse_txt_reply_ext`
  
  Introduce `ares_txt_ext` structure with an extra `record_start`
  field, which indicates a start of a new TXT record, thus allowing to
  differentiate the chunks in the same record, from a chunks in a
  different record.
  
  Introduce a new API method: `ares_parse_txt_reply_ext` that works with
  this kind of struct.

- doc: update badge locations to master repo

- test: Enable maintainer mode + debug in Travis

- test: Add an iOS build target

- test: Ignore SIGPIPE in tests

- test: More initialization tests

- test: Improve containerized test mechanism
  
  Aim is to ensure that code coverage information can escape the
  container.  To do this:
   - Enter a new mount namespace too, so that we can...
   - Bind mount the expected source directory into the container
   - Share memory with the sub-process so coverage information is
     shared too.

- test: Make contained tests easier to write

- test: Add framework for containerized testing
  
  On Linux we can potentially use user and UTS namespaces to run  a test
  in a pseudo-container with:
   - arbitrary filesystem (e.g. /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/hosts)
   - arbitrary hostname/domainname.
  
  Include a first pass at the framework code to allow this, along with a
  first test case that uses the container.

- test: Use a longer timeout for less flakiness
  
  Having occasional test failures from timeout before multiple
  queries can complete, so up the default timeout for the test
  from 100ms to 1500ms.

- test: Make failure tests more robust
  
  Different platforms will do different numbers of allocations
  in the processing of a given API call; just check that the
  return code is either success or ENOMEM, and free off any
  returned state in the former case.
  
  Also cope with ECONNREFUSED as well as ENOTFOUND.

- test: Get test code building under Windows
  
   - Initial nmake file based off library nmake file
   - Cast socket call arguments to (char *)
   - Use wrapper sclose() that maps to closesocket() or close()
   - Build a config.h indicating presence of headers
   - Conditionally include netdb.h
   - Remove unnecessary include of sys/socket.h
   - Force longer bitmask for allocation failure tracking

- test: Allow for multiple mock servers
  
   - Update the MockServer to allow separate specification of
     UDP and TCP ports
   - Have an array of mock servers listening on consecutive
     sets of ports.
   - Rename Process(fd) to ProcessFD(fd) to avoid confusion.
   - Initialize channel by using the new ares_set_servers_ports()
     entrypoint, so multiple ports on the same loopback address
     can be used.

- test: Update test for set/get_servers variants
  
  Ports are significant in the _ports_ variant functions, so update test to cope.

- test: Make GetNameServers() utility function port-aware
  
  Also make it generally available.

- test: more testing, including of internal static functions

   - Add an allocation failure test for each parsing function.
   - Add error check test for each parsing function.

- test: Add various additional tests

- test: More tests
  
  Include tests of internal functions, based on the value of the
  CARES_SYMBOL_HIDING macro; need to configure the library with
  --disable-symbol-hiding to enable these tests.

- test: Allow command line override of mock server port

- test: Add README.md documentation

- test: Temporarily avoid latest Python requests package

- test: Add AppVeyor config file for Windows build

- test: Add configuration for a Travis build
  
  Cover Linux & OSX on the container infrastructure, but install
  a later G++ to satisfy the tests' need for C++11.
  
  Use a build matrix to include a variety of build variants:
   - ASAN
   - UBSAN
   - LSAN
   - Coverage via coveralls.io
  
  test: invoke ASAN and coverage in Travis build
  
  Also shift to use explicit build matrix
  
  test: Use coveralls.io for coverage tracking
  
  test: Add a build with UBSAN
  
  Also expand and re-order the setting of environment variables
  for easier modification.
  
  test: Add LSAN build to Travis config

- test: Add initial unit tests for c-ares library
  
  The tests are written in C++11, using the GoogleTest and GoogleMock
  frameworks.  They have their own independent autoconf setup, so that
  users of the library need not have a C++ compiler just to get c-ares
  working (however, the test/configure.ac file does assume the use of
  a shared top-level m4/ directory).  However, this autoconf setup has
  only been tested on Linux and OSX so far.
  
  Run with "./arestest", or "./arestest -v" to see extra debug info.
  The GoogleTest options for running specific tests are also
  available (e.g. "./arestest --gtest_filter=*Live*").
  
  The tests are nowhere near complete yet (currently hitting around
  60% coverage as reported by gcov), but they do include examples
  of a few different styles of testing:
  
   - There are live tests (ares-test-live.cc), which assume that the
     current machine has a valid DNS setup and connection to the
     internet; these tests issue queries for real domains but don't
     particularly check what gets returned.  The tests will fail on
     an offline machine.
  
   - There a few mock tests (ares-test-mock.cc) that set up a fake DNS
     server and inject its port into the c-ares library configuration.
     These tests allow specific response messages to be crafted and
     injected, and so are likely to be used for many more tests in
     future.
  
      - To make this generation/injection easier, the dns-proto.h file
        includes C++ helper classes for building DNS packets.
  
   - Other library entrypoints that don't require network activity
     (e.g. ares_parse_*_reply) are tested directly.
  
   - There are few tests of library-internal functions that are not
     normally visible to API users (in ares-test-internal.cc).
  
   - A couple of the tests use a helper method of the test fixture to
     inject memory allocation failures, using the earlier change to the
     library to allow override of malloc/realloc/free.
  
   - There is also an entrypoint to allow Clang's libfuzzer to drive
     the packet parsing code in ares_parse_*_reply, together with a
     standalone wrapper for it (./aresfuzz) to allow use of afl-fuzz
     for further fuzz testing.

- test: Add local copy of GoogleMock/GoogleTest 1.7.0
  
  Don't check in gtest/m4 files, as they are unused and interfere

- build: Allow header compilation by Windows C++ compiler

- build: Expose whether symbol hiding is on
  
  Adding the CARES_SYMBOL_HIDING definition allows the test suite to
  detect whether internal symbols are available or not.

- build: Add autoconf macros for C++11 code using pthreads
  
  Pull in testing macros from the GNU autoconf archive to allow
  configure scripts to test for and setup use of a C++11 compiler
  (AX_CXX_COMPILE_STDCXX_11) and the pthreads library (AX_PTHREAD).
  
  Note that these macros are not used by the main library autoconf,
  just by the tests (which share the same m4/ directory).

- build: Add a code coverage option
  
  Configure with:
    ./configure --enable-code-coverage
  Show coverage output with:
    make code-coverage-capture
  
  Built on m4/ax_code_coverage.m4 from the GNU autoconf archive
  to provide the macros to check for presence of gcov + lcov;
  upstream macro modified to:
   - Remove use of $(AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY) , as earlier versions of
     autoconf (such as the one used by default on Travis) do not have this.
   - Rather than automatically defining CODE_COVERAGE_RULES to be a set
     of makefile rules that use ifeq/endif (which is GNU make-specific),
     instead only define CODE_COVERAGE_RULES if coverages is turned on,
     and in that case don't use conditionals in the makefile.

- api: Add entrypoints to allow use of per-server ports
  
  Add user-visible entrypoints ares_{get,set}_servers_ports(3), which
  take struct ares_addr_port_node rather than struct ares_addr_node.
  This structure includes a UDP and TCP port number; if this is set
  to zero, the channel-wide port values are used as before.
  
  Similarly, add a new ares_set_servers_ports_csv(3) entrypoint, which
  is analogous to ares_set_servers(3) except it doesn't ignore any
  specified port information; instead, any per-server specified port
  is used as both the UDP and TCP port for that server.
  
  The internal struct ares_addr is extended to hold the UDP/TCP ports,
  stored in network order, with the convention that a value of zero
  indicates that the channel-wide UDP/TCP port should be used.
  
  For the internal implementation of ares_dup(3), shift to use the
  _ports() version of the get/set functions, so port information is
  transferred correctly to the new channel.
  
  Update manpages, and add missing ares_set_servers_csv to the lists
  while we're at it

- api: Add ares_set_sortlist(3) entrypoint
  
  Allow explicit configuration of the channel's sortlist, by
  specifying a string in the same format as the equivalent
  /etc/resolv.conf option.
  
  This allows library users to perform the same configuration
  that is available via /etc/resolv.conf, but without needing
  to change that file.

- api: Allow injection of user-specified malloc/free functions
  
  Add a new ares_library_init_mem() initialization function for the
  library which allows the library user to specify their own malloc,
  realloc & free equivalents for use library-wide.
  
  Store these function pointers in library-wide global variables,
  defaulting to libc's malloc(), realloc() and free().
  
  Change all calls to malloc, realloc and free to use the function pointer
  instead.  Also ensure that ares_strdup() is always available
  (even if the local environment includes strdup(3)), and change the
  library code to always use it.
  
  Convert calls to calloc() to use ares_malloc() + memset

- api: Add option to expose some internal functions
  
  Purely for testing, add --enable-expose-statics option to configure
  which converts some static internal functions to be externally visible.

- api: Expose the ares_library_initialized() function

- ahost: Allow repeated -s <domain> options
  
  This also removes a potential leak where later -s options would
  replace earlier ones without freeing the relevant string.

- Mark unhittable lines
  
  Add comments for the benefit of the lcov tool, marking
  lines that cannot be hit.  Typically these are fall-back
  protection arms that are already covered by earlier checks,
  and so it's not worth taking out the unhittable code (in case
  someone changes the code between the two places in future).

- ares_set_servers_csv.3: make return type match code

- bitncmp: update comment to match code behaviour

- ares_striendstr: fix so non-NULL return can happen
  
  This looks to have been broken since it was first introduced in 2005 in
  commit aba0b775ea30 ("Added ares_getnameinfo which mimics the
  getnameinfo API")

- config_sortlist: free any existing sortlist on (re)alloc failure
  
  If we get an allocation failure on 2nd or later entry in the sortlist, the
  code would return ENOMEM but still leave the initial entries allocated.
  Ensure that *sortlist is set to NULL whenever ENOMEM is returned.

- ares_dup: clear new channel on failure
  
  If the attempt to transfer IPv6 servers from the old to the new channel
  fails, the previous code would still return a channel to the user even though
  an error return code was generated.  This makes it likely that users would
  leak the channel, so explicitly clear the channel in this case.

- ares_init_options: don't lose init failure
  
  If (say) init_by_options() fails, the subsequent call to
  init_by_defaults() was overwriting the return code with
  success.  Still call init_by_defaults() regardless, but track
  its return value separately

- ares_gethostbyname: don't leak valid-but-empty hostent
  
  If an AF_UNSPEC query gets a valid response to its AAAA query,
  but which has no IPv6 addresses in it, then the code chains on to
  a A record query.  However, the hostent from the AAAA response
  was being leaked along the way (because it gets replaced before
  the follow-on end_hquery() invocation).

- ares_parse_txt_reply: propagate errors from per-substring loop
  
  If we get an allocation failure when processing a particular substring in a
  TXT record, that failure is silently lost; fix that by propagating errors from
  the inner loop to the outer loop.

- process_answer: fix things up correctly when removing EDNS option
  
  When a server rejects an EDNS-equipped request, we retry without
  the EDNS option.  However, in TCP mode, the 2-byte length prefix was
  being calculated wrong -- it was built from the answer length rather than
  the length of the original request.
  
  Also, it is theoretically possible that the call to realloc() might change
  the data pointed to; to allow for this, qbuf also needs updating.
  
  (Both these fixes were actually included in a patchset sent on the mailing
  list in Oct 2012, but were included with other functional changes that
  didn't get merged:
  http://c-ares.haxx.se/mail/c-ares-archive-2012-10/0004.shtml)

- ares__read_line: clear buf pointer on realloc failure

- ares_expand_name: check for valid bits in label length
  
  The top two bits of the label length indicate whether this is a
  label length (00) or an index to a name elsewhere in the message
  (11).  RFC1035 4.1.4 says that the other possible values for the
  top two bits (01, 10) are reserved for future use.

  Fixing slow DNS lookup issue
  
  This patch is fixing the dns lookup issue due to dummy dns information
  of a disconnected adapter(in my case is a bluetooth adapter). I changed
  the dns lookup policy to try GetNetworkParams first because the
  GetNetworkParams provides the most reliable dns information (lots of
  checks were done by system). I also filter out inoperable adapter in
  DNS_AdaptersAddresses in case GetNetworkParams fail.

  Continue loop if space for hostname not large enough
  
  When attempting to build a search domain from the local hostname

  Fix integer shift overflow if both tcp_socket and udp_socket are set
  
  The problem occurs if at the start of the loop the sockindex is at the
  last valid ARES_GETSOCK_MAXNUM position. If then both udp_socket and
  tcp_socket are valid, sockindex gets incremented for UDP first and
  points one entry behind the array for the tcp block.
  So the fix is to check after every increment of sockindex if it is still
  valid.

- host_callback: Fall back to AF_INET on searching with AF_UNSPEC
  
  Previously, when an ares_gethostbyname() searched with AF_UNSPEC and the
  first AF_INET6 call only returned CNAMEs, the host_callback never
  retried AF_INET.
  
  This patch makes sure than on ARES_SUCCESS, the result of AF_INET6 is
  taken as authoritative only if the result contains some addresses.

  ares_build.h: fix building on 64-bit powerpc
  
  There are two issues.
  
  1. gcc actually does not use __ppc__ and __ppc64__ but __PPC__ and
  __PPC64__.  The tests of __ILP32__ and __LP64__ are sufficient for gcc.
  
  2. clang defines __GNU__ and defines both __ppc64__ and __ppc__ when
  targeting ppc64.  This makes CARES_SIZEOF_LONG to be 4 on a ppc64 system
  when building with clang.
  
  My patch is two change the order of the checks so that we check the
  64-bit case first.

- refresh: updated now with automake 1.14

- [David Drysdale brought this change]

  single_domain: Invalid memory access for empty string input
  
  We noticed a small buglet in ares_search() when it gets an empty string

  library init: documentation update
  
  This commit updates the documentation of ares_library_init() and
  ares_library_cleanup() with regard to the newly introduced reference
  counting of initializations and deinitializations.

- [Alexander Klauer brought this change]

  library init: be recursive
  
  Previously, a single call to ares_library_cleanup() would deinitialise
  the c-ares library, regardless of how many times ares_library_init() was
  called. This behaviour may cause problems in programs linking two or
  more libraries which, in turn, use c-ares. The present commit fixes this
  problem, deinitializing the library only after a number of calls to
  ares_library_cleanup() matching the number of calls to
  ares_library_init().

  Documentation: properly document ARES_ECANCELLED
  
  This commit clarifies the behaviour of ares_cancel() with respect to

  pages of the affected functions.

- [Alexander Klauer brought this change]

  ares_cancel(): cancel requests safely
  
  An invocation of ares_cancel() walks through the request list, calling
  the callbacks of all pending requests on a channel. Previously, if such
  a callback added a new request to the channel, the request list might
  not end up empty, causing an abort by assertion failure. The present
  commit ensures that precisely all requests present upon entry of
  ares_cancel() are cancelled, and that adding new requests through
  callbacks is safe.

- ares.h: stricter CARES_EXTERN linkage decorations logic

    gcc 4.7 or newer.
  
  - keep 32bit processor architecture checks in order to support gcc
    versions older than 4.7 which don't define __ILP32__

- cares-override.m4: provide AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR definition conditionally

- configure: check if compiler halts on function prototype mismatch

- cares-functions.m4: add gethostname arg 2 data type check and definition

- cares-functions.m4: update thread-safeness detection of getaddrinfo()
  
  Take in account that POSIX standard Issue 7 drops h_errno support. Now, we also
  consider getaddrinfo() to be thread-safe when (_POSIX_C_SOURCE >= 200809L) or
  (_XOPEN_SOURCE >= 700) independently of whether h_errno exists or not.
  
  Take in account that h_errno might be a modifiable lvalue not defined as
  a C preprocessor macro.

- setup_once.h: HP-UX <sys/socket.h> issue workaround
  
  Issue: When building a 32bit target with large file support HP-UX
  <sys/socket.h> header file may simultaneously provide two different
  sets of declarations for sendfile and sendpath functions, one with
  static and another with external linkage. Given that we do not use
  mentioned functions we really don't care which linkage is the
  appropriate one, but on the other hand, the double declaration emmits
  warnings when using the HP-UX compiler and errors when using modern
  gcc versions resulting in fatal compilation errors.
  
  Mentioned issue is now fixed as long as we don't use sendfile nor
  sendpath functions.

- setup_once.h: refactor inclusion of <unistd.h> and <sys/socket.h>
  
  Inclusion of these two header files now done in setup_once.h

- Header inclusion clean-up

  Fix UDP and TCP port byte order in saved options.
  
  The UDP and TCP port are stored in network byte order in the

  order.  Thus we must return them from ares_save_options() in host byte
  order too, or a duplicated channel will convert them again, leading to a
  nonfunctional channel and a mysterious connection refused error from
  ares_gethostbyname().  This breaks ares_dup(), thus the curl easy API
  when c-ares is used by curl, and thus all the curl easy API's users.
