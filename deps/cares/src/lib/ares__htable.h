/*! \addtogroup ares__htable Base HashTable Data Structure
 *
 * This is a basic hashtable data structure that is meant to be wrapped
 * by a higher level implementation.  This data structure is designed to
 * be callback-based in order to facilitate wrapping without needing to
 * worry about any underlying complexities of the hashtable implementation.
 *
 * This implementation supports automatic growing by powers of 2 when reaching
 * 75% capacity.  A rehash will be performed on the expanded bucket list.
 *
 * Average time complexity:
 *  - Insert: O(1)
 *  - Search: O(1)
 *  - Delete: O(1)
