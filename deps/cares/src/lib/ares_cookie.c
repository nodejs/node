/* DNS cookies are a simple form of learned mutual authentication supported by
 * most DNS server implementations these days and can help prevent DNS Cache
 * Poisoning attacks for clients and DNS amplification attacks for servers.
 *
 * A good overview is here:
 * https://www.dotmagazine.online/issues/digital-responsibility-and-sustainability/dns-cookies-transaction-mechanism
 *
 * RFCs used for implementation are
 * [RFC7873](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7873) which is extended by
 * [RFC9018](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9018).
 *
 * Though this could be used on TCP, the likelihood of it being useful is small
 * and could cause some issues.  TCP is better used as a fallback in case there
 * are issues with DNS Cookie support in the upstream servers (e.g. AnyCast
 * cluster issues).
 *
 * While most recursive DNS servers support DNS Cookies, public DNS servers like
 * Google (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) and CloudFlare (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1) don't seem to
 * have this enabled yet for unknown reasons.
 *
 * The risk to having DNS Cookie support always enabled is nearly zero as there
 * is built-in detection support and it will simply bypass using cookies if the
 * remote server doesn't support it.  The problem arises if a remote server
 * supports DNS cookies, then stops supporting them (such as if an administrator
 * reconfigured the server, or maybe there are different servers in a cluster
 * with different configurations).  We need to detect this behavior by tracking
 * how much time has gone by since we received our last valid cookie reply, and
 * if we exceed the threshold, reset all cookie parameters like we haven't
 * attempted a request yet.
 *
 * ## Implementation Plan
 *
 * ### Constants:
 *  - `COOKIE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`: 86400s (1 day)
 *     - How often to regenerate the per-server client cookie, even if our
 *       source ip address hasn't changed.
 *  - `COOKIE_UNSUPPORTED_TIMEOUT`: 300s (5 minutes)
 *     - If a server responds without a cookie in the reply, this is how long to
 *       wait before attempting to send a client cookie again.
 *  - `COOKIE_REGRESSION_TIMEOUT`: 120s (2 minutes)
 *     - If a server was once known to return cookies, and all of a sudden stops
 *       returning cookies (but the reply is otherwise valid), this is how long
 *       to continue to attempt to use cookies before giving up and resetting.
 *       Such an event would cause an outage for this duration, but since a
 *       cache poisoning attack should be dropping invalid replies we should be
 *       able to still get the valid reply and not assume it is a server
 *       regression just because we received replies without cookies.
 *  - `COOKIE_RESEND_MAX`: 3
 *    - Maximum times to resend a query to a server due to the server responding
 *      with `BAD_COOKIE`, after this, we switch to TCP.
 *
 * ### Per-server variables:
 *  - `cookie.state`: Known state of cookie support, enumeration.
 *    - `INITIAL` (0): Initial state, not yet determined. Used during startup.
 *    - `GENERATED` (1): Cookie has been generated and sent to a server, but no
 *      validated response yet.
 *    - `SUPPORTED` (2):  Server has been determined to properly support cookies
 *    - `UNSUPPORTED` (3): Server has been determined to not support cookies
 *  - `cookie.client` : 8 byte randomly generated client cookie
 *  - `cookie.client_ts`: Timestamp client cookie was generated
 *  - `cookie.client_ip`: IP address client used to connect to server
 *  - `cookie.server`: 8 to 32 byte server cookie
 *  - `cookie.server_len`: length of server cookie
 *  - `cookie.unsupported_ts`: Timestamp of last attempt to use a cookies, but
 *    it was determined that the server didn't support them.
 *
 * ### Per-query variables:
 *  - `query.client_cookie`: Duplicate of `cookie.client` at the point in time
 *    the query is put on the wire.  This should be available in the
 *    `ares_dns_record_t` for the request for verification purposes so we don't
 *    actually need to duplicate this, just naming it here for the ease of
 *    documentation below.
 * - `query.cookie_try_count`: Number of tries to send a cookie but receive
 *   `BAD_COOKIE` responses.  Used to know when we need to switch to TCP.
 *
 * ### Procedure:
 * **NOTE**: These steps will all be done after obtaining a connection handle as
 * some of these steps depend on determining the source ip address for the
 * connection.
 *
 * 1. If the query is not using EDNS, then **skip any remaining processing**.
 * 2. If using TCP, ensure there is no EDNS cookie opt (10) set (there may have
 *    been if this is a resend after upgrade to TCP), then **skip any remaining
 *    processing**.
 * 3. If `cookie.state == SUPPORTED`, `cookie.unsupported_ts` is non-zero, and
 *    evaluates greater than `COOKIE_REGRESSION_TIMEOUT`, then clear all cookie
 *    settings, set `cookie.state = INITIAL`. Continue to next step (4)
 * 4. If `cookie.state == UNSUPPORTED`
 *     - If `cookie.unsupported_ts` evaluates less than
 *       `COOKIE_UNSUPPORTED_TIMEOUT`
 *        - Ensure there is no EDNS cookie opt (10) set (shouldn't be unless
 *          requester had put this themselves), then **skip any remaining
 *          processing** as we don't want to try to send cookies.
 *     - Otherwise:
 *       - clear all cookie settings, set `cookie.state = INITIAL`.
 *       - Continue to next step (5) which will send a new cookie.
 * 5. If `cookie.state == INITIAL`:
 *    - randomly generate new `cookie.client`
 *    - set `cookie.client_ts` to the current timestamp.
 *    - set `cookie.state = GENERATED`.
 *    - set `cookie.client_ip` to the current source ip address.
 * 6. If `cookie.state == GENERATED || cookie.state == SUPPORTED` and
 *    `cookie.client_ip` does not match the current source ip address:
 *    - clear `cookie.server`
 *    - randomly generate new `cookie.client`
 *    - set `cookie.client_ts` to the current timestamp.
 *    - set `cookie.client_ip` to the current source ip address.
 *    - do not change the `cookie.state`
 * 7. If `cookie.state == SUPPORTED` and `cookie.client_ts` evaluation exceeds
 *    `COOKIE_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`:
 *    - clear `cookie.server`
 *    - randomly generate new `cookie.client`
 *    - set `cookie.client_ts` to the current timestamp.
 *    - set `cookie.client_ip` to the current source ip address.
 *    - do not change the `cookie.state`
 * 8. Generate EDNS OPT record (10) for client cookie.  The option value will be
 *    the `cookie.client` concatenated with the `cookie.server`.  If there is no
 *    known server cookie, it will not be appended. Copy `cookie.client` to
 *    `query.client_cookie` to handle possible client cookie changes by other
 *    queries before a reply is received (technically this is in the cached
 *    `ares_dns_record_t` so no need to manually do this). Send request to
 *    server.
 * 9. Evaluate response:
 *     1. If invalid EDNS OPT cookie (10) length sent back in response (valid
 *        length is 16-40), or bad client cookie value (validate first 8 bytes
 *        against `query.client_cookie` not `cookie.client`), **drop response**
 *        as if it hadn't been received.  This is likely a spoofing attack.
 *        Wait for valid response up to normal response timeout.
 *     2. If a EDNS OPT cookie (10) server cookie is returned:
 *         - set `cookie.unsupported_ts` to zero and `cookie.state = SUPPORTED`.
 *           We can confirm this server supports cookies based on the existence
 *           of this record.
 *         - If a new EDNS OPT cookie (10) server cookie is in the response, and
 *           the `client.cookie` matches the `query.client_cookie` still (hasn't
 *           been rotated by some other parallel query), save it as
 *           `cookie.server`.
 *     3. If dns response `rcode` is `BAD_COOKIE`:
 *         - Ensure a EDNS OPT cookie (10) is returned, otherwise **drop
 *           response**, this is completely invalid and likely an spoof of some
 *           sort.
 *         - Otherwise
 *           - Increment `query.cookie_try_count`
 *           - If `query.cookie_try_count >= COOKIE_RESEND_MAX`, set
 *             `query.using_tcp` to force the next attempt to use TCP.
 *           - **Requeue the query**, but do not increment the normal
 *             `try_count` as a `BAD_COOKIE` reply isn't a normal try failure.
 *             This should end up going all the way back to step 1 on the next
 *             attempt.
 *     4. If EDNS OPT cookie (10) is **NOT** returned in the response:
 *         - If `cookie.state == SUPPORTED`
 *           - if `cookie.unsupported_ts` is zero, set to the current timestamp.
 *           - Drop the response, wait for a valid response to be returned
 *         - if `cookie.state == GENERATED`
 *           - clear all cookie settings
 *           - set `cookie.state = UNSUPPORTED`
 *           - set `cookie.unsupported_ts` to the current time
 *         - Accept response (state should be `UNSUPPORTED` if we're here)
