/*! \addtogroup ares__buf Safe Data Builder and buffer
 *
 * This is a buffer building and parsing framework with a focus on security over
 * performance. All data to be read from the buffer will perform explicit length
 * validation and return a success/fail result.  There are also various helpers
 * for writing data to the buffer which dynamically grows.
 *
 * All operations that fetch or consume data from the buffer will move forward
 * the internal pointer, thus marking the data as processed which may no longer
 * be accessible after certain operations (such as append).
 *
 * The helpers for this object are meant to be added as needed.  If you can't
 * find it, write it!
