.TH ARES_EXPAND_NAME 3 "20 Nov 2009"
.SH NAME
ares_expand_name \- Expand a DNS-encoded domain name
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_expand_name(const unsigned char *\fIencoded\fP,
                     const unsigned char *\fIabuf\fP, int \fIalen\fP,
                     char **\fIs\fP, long *\fIenclen\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ares_expand_name
function converts a DNS-encoded domain name to a dot-separated C
string.  The argument
.I encoded
gives the beginning of the encoded domain name, and the arguments
.I abuf
and
.I alen
give the containing message buffer (necessary for the processing of
indirection pointers within the encoded domain name).  The result is
placed in a NUL-terminated allocated buffer, a pointer to which is
stored in the variable pointed to by
.IR s .
The length of the encoded name is stored in the variable pointed to by
.I enclen
so that the caller can advance past the encoded domain name to read
further data in the message.

Use \fIares_free_string(3)\fP to free the allocated hostname.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.B ares_expand_name
can return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
Expansion of the encoded name succeeded.
.TP 15
.B ARES_EBADNAME
The encoded domain name was malformed and could not be expanded.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOMEM
Memory was exhausted.
