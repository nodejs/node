.TH ARES_EXPAND_NAME 3 "20 Nov 2009"
.SH NAME
ares_expand_string \- Expand a length encoded string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_expand_string(const unsigned char *\fIencoded\fP,
                       const unsigned char *\fIabuf\fP, int \fIalen\fP,
                       unsigned char **\fIs\fP, long *\fIenclen\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ares_expand_string
function converts a length encoded string to a NUL-terminated C
string.  The argument
.I encoded
gives the beginning of the encoded string, and the arguments
.I abuf
and
.I alen
give the containing message buffer (necessary for the processing of
indirection pointers within the encoded domain name).  The result is
placed in a NUL-terminated allocated buffer, a pointer to which is
stored in the variable pointed to by
.IR s .
The length of the encoded string is stored in the variable pointed to by
.I enclen
so that the caller can advance past the encoded string to read
further data in the message.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.B ares_expand_string
can return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
Expansion of the encoded string succeeded.
.TP 15
.B ARES_EBADSTR
The encoded string was malformed and could not be expanded.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOMEM
Memory was exhausted.
