.SH DESCRIPTION

.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Send queries to DNS servers about \fINAME\fR and print received
information, where \fINAME\fR is a valid DNS name (e.g. www.example.com,
1.2.3.10.in-addr.arpa).
.PP
This utility comes with the \fBc\-ares\fR asynchronous resolver library.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR class
Set the query class.
Possible values for class are
NY, CHAOS, HS, IN (default).
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Print some extra debugging output.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR flag
Add a flag.
Possible values for flag are
igntc, noaliases, norecurse, primary, stayopen, usevc.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR port
Use specified TCP port to connect to DNS server.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR server
Connect to specified DNS server, instead of the system's default one(s).
.TP
\fB\-t\fR type
Query records of specified type.
Possible values for type are
A (default), AAAA, AFSDB, ANY, AXFR, CNAME, GPOS, HINFO, ISDN, KEY, LOC, MAILA,
MAILB, MB, MD, MF, MG, MINFO, MR, MX, NAPTR, NS, NSAP, NSAP_PTR, NULL,
PTR, PX, RP, RT, SIG, SOA, SRV, TXT, URI, WKS, X25,
.TP
\fB\-U\fR port
Use specified UDP port to connect to DNS server.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR
For an IPv4 \fB-t PTR a.b.c.d\fR lookup, query for
.br
\fBd.c.b.a.in-addr.arpa.\fR
This more often gives correct names in the \fBANSWER\fR.
.br
For an IPv6 \fB-t PTR addr\fR lookup, query for \fBa.b.c....z.IP6.ARPA.\fR
.TP
\fB\-xx\fR
As for \fB-x\fR and an IPv6 address, compact \fBa.b.c....z.IP6.ARPA.\fR into a RFC-2673 bit-string.
This compacted \fBbit-string\fR form is not supported by many DNS-servers.
