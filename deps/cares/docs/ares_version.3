.TH ARES_VERSION 3 "29 January 2004"
.SH NAME
ares_version \- Get the version number of the library
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

const char *ares_version(int *\fIversion\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBares_version(3)\fP function gets the library version as a string and
optionally as an integer stored in the \fIversion\fP argument. If you pass a
NULL, no integer is attempted to be returned.

The integer is built up as 24bit number, with 8 separate bits used for major
number, minor number and patch number. This makes a version string such as
1.2.3 will be returned as the hexadecimal number 0x010203 (decimal 66051).
