.SH NAME
ares_parse_ptr_reply \- Parse a reply to a DNS query of type PTR into a hostent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_parse_ptr_reply(const unsigned char *\fIabuf\fP, int \fIalen\fP,
                         const void *\fIaddr\fP, int \fIaddrlen\fP,
                         int \fIfamily\fP, struct hostent **\fIhost\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ares_parse_ptr_reply
function parses the response to a query of type PTR into a
.BR "struct hostent" .
The parameters
.I abuf
and
.I alen
give the contents of the response.  The parameters
.IR addr ,
.IR addrlen ,
and
.I family
specify which address was queried for; they are not used to verify the
response, merely used to fill in the address of the
.BR "struct hostent" .
The resulting
.B struct hostent
is stored in allocated memory and a pointer to it stored into the
variable pointed to by
.IR host .
It is the caller's responsibility to free the resulting host structure
using
.BR ares_free_hostent (3)
when it is no longer needed.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.B ares_parse_ptr_reply
can return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
The response was successfully parsed.
.TP 15
.B ARES_EBADRESP
The response was malformatted.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENODATA
The response did not contain an answer to the query.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOMEM
Memory was exhausted.
