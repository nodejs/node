.TH ARES_GET_SERVERS 3 "5 March 2010"
.SH NAME
ares_get_servers, ares_get_servers_ports \- Retrieve name servers from an initialized ares_channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_get_servers(ares_channel_t *\fIchannel\fP,
                     struct ares_addr_node **\fIservers\fP)

int ares_get_servers_ports(ares_channel_t *\fIchannel\fP,
                           struct ares_addr_port_node **\fIservers\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBares_get_servers(3)\fP function retrieves name servers configuration
from the
channel data identified by
.IR channel ,
as a linked list of ares_addr_node structs storing a pointer to the first
node at the address specified by
.IR servers .

The \fBares_get_servers_ports(3)\fP function also retrieves any per-server
port information that may have been previously configured, returning a linked
list of ares_addr_port structures.

Function caller may traverse the returned name server linked list, or may use
it directly as suitable input for the \fBares_set_servers(3)\fP /
\fBares_set_servers_ports(3)\fP functions, but
shall not shrink or extend the list on its own.

Each node of the name server linked list is stored in memory dynamically
allocated and managed by c-ares. It is the caller's responsibility to free
the resulting linked list, using \fBares_free_data(3)\fP , once the caller
does not need it any longer.

This function is capable of handling IPv4 and IPv6 name server
addresses simultaneously, rendering \fBares_save_options(3)\fP with
optmask \fBARES_OPT_SERVERS\fP functionally obsolete except for
IPv4-only name server usage.

.SH RETURN VALUES
This function may return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
The name servers configuration was successfully retrieved
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOMEM
The memory was exhausted
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENODATA
The channel data identified by
.IR channel
was invalid.
.SH SEE ALSO

.BR ares_init_options (3),

.SH AVAILABILITY
\fBares_get_servers(3)\fP was added in c-ares 1.7.1;
\fBares_get_servers_ports(3)\fP was added in c-ares 1.11.0.
