.TH ARES_SAVE_OPTIONS 3 "5 March 2010"
.SH NAME
ares_save_options \- Save configuration values obtained from initialized ares_channel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_save_options(const ares_channel_t *\fIchannel\fP,
                      struct ares_options *\fIoptions\fP, int *\fIoptmask\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBares_save_options(3)\fP function saves the channel data identified by
.IR channel ,
into the options struct identified by
.IR options ,
and saves the mask of options which are set to the integer
pointer (passed by reference) identified by
.IR optmask .

The resultant options and optmask are then able to be
passed directly to ares_init_options.  When the options
are no longer needed, ares_destroy_options should be called
to free any associated memory.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.B ares_save_options(3)
can return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
The channel data was successfully stored
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOMEM
The memory was exhausted
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENODATA
The channel data identified by
.IR channel
were invalid.
.SH NOTE
Since c-ares 1.6.0 the ares_options struct has been "locked" meaning that it
won't be extended to cover new functions. This function will remain
functioning, but it can only return config data that can be represented in
this config struct, which may no longer be the complete set of config
options. \fBares_dup(3)\fP will not have that restriction.

The ares_options struct can not handle potential IPv6 name servers the
ares channel might be configured to use. The \fBares_save_options(3)\fP function
will only return IPv4 servers, if any. In order to retrieve all name servers
an ares channel might be using, the \fBares_get_servers(3)\fP function must be
used instead.
