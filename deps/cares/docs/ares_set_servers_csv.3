.TH ARES_SET_SERVERS_CSV 3 "5 Dec 2023"
.SH NAME
ares_set_servers_csv, ares_set_servers_ports_csv, ares_get_servers_csv \- Set
or Get a list of DNS servers used for queries.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_set_servers_csv(ares_channel_t *\fIchannel\fP, const char* \fIservers\fP)

int ares_set_servers_ports_csv(ares_channel_t *\fIchannel\fP, const char* \fIservers\fP)

char *ares_get_servers_csv(const ares_channel_t *\fIchannel\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBares_set_servers_csv\fP and \fBares_set_servers_ports_csv\fP functions set
the list of DNS servers that c-ares will query.  As of v1.22.0 this function can
be called on an active channel with running queries, previously it would return
ARES_ENOTIMP.

Though not recommended, passing NULL for servers will clear all configured
servers and make an inoperable channel, this may be advantageous for test
simulation but unlikely to be useful in production.

The \fBares_get_servers_csv\fP retrieves the list of servers in comma delimited
format.

The input and output format is a comma separated list of servers.  Two formats
are available, the typical \fBresolv.conf(5)\fP \fInameserver\fP format, as
well as a \fIURI\fP format.  Both formats can be used at the same time in the
provided CSV string.

The \fInameserver\fP format is:
.nf

ip[:port][%iface]

.fi
.RS 4
The \fBip\fP may be encapsulated in square brackets ([ ]), and must be if
using ipv6 and also specifying a port.

The \fBport\fP is optional, and will default to 53 or the value specified in
\fBares_init_options(3)\fP.

The \fBiface\fP is specific to IPv6 link-local servers (fe80::/10) and should
not otherwise be used.
.RE

\fInameserver\fP format examples:
.nf

192.168.1.100
192.168.1.101:53
[1:2:3::4]:53
[fe80::1]:53%eth0

.fi
.PP

The \fIURI\fP format is is made up of these defined schemes:
.RS 4
\fIdns://\fP - Normal DNS server (UDP + TCP). We need to be careful not to
conflict with query params defined in RFC4501 since we'd technically be
extending this URI scheme. Port defaults to 53.

\fIdns+tls://\fP - DNS over TLS. Port defaults to 853.

\fIdns+https://\fP - DNS over HTTPS. Port defaults to 443.
.RE

.PP
Query parameters are defined as below.  Additional parameters may be defined
in the future.

.RS 4
\fItcpport\fP - TCP port to use, only for \fIdns://\fP scheme. The port
specified as part of the authority component of the URI will be used for both
UDP and TCP by default, this option will override the TCP port.

\fIipaddr\fP - Only for \fIdns+tls://\fP and \fIdns+https://\fP. If the
authority component of the URI contains a hostname, this is used to specify the
ip address of the hostname. If not specified, will need to use a non-secure
server to perform a DNS lookup to retrieve this information. It is always
recommended to have both the ip address and fully qualified domain name
specified.

\fIhostname\fP - Only for \fIdns+tls://\fP and \fIdns+https://\fP. If the
authority component of the URI contains an ip address, this is used to specify
the fully qualified domain name of the server. If not specified, will need to
use a non-secure server to perform a DNS reverse lookup to retrieve this
information. It is always recommended to have both the ip address and fully
qualified domain name specified.

\fIdomain\fP - If specified, this server is a domain-specific server. Any
queries for this domain will be routed to this server. Multiple servers may be
tagged with the same domain.

\fIURI\fP format Examples:
.nf

dns://8.8.8.8
dns://[2001:4860:4860::8888]
dns://[fe80::b542:84df:1719:65e3%en0]
dns://192.168.1.1:55
dns://192.168.1.1?tcpport=1153
dns://10.0.1.1?domain=myvpn.com
dns+tls://8.8.8.8?hostname=dns.google
dns+tls://one.one.one.one?ipaddr=1.1.1.1

.fi

\fBNOTE\fP: While we are defining the scheme for things like domain-specific
servers, DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS, the underlying implementations for
those features do not yet exist and therefore will result in errors if they are
attempted to be used.

.PP
As of c-ares 1.24.0, \fBares_set_servers_csv\fP and \fBares_set_servers_ports_csv\fP
are identical.  Prior versions would simply omit ports in \fBares_set_servers_csv\fP
but due to the addition of link local interface support, this difference was
removed.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.B ares_set_servers_csv(3)
and
.B ares_set_servers_ports_csv(3)
may return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
The name servers configuration was successfully initialized.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOMEM
The process's available memory was exhausted.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENODATA
The channel data identified by
.IR channel
was invalid.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOTINITIALIZED
c-ares library initialization not yet performed.
.PP
.B ares_get_servers_csv(3)
returns a string representing the servers configured which must be freed with
\fBares_free_string(3)\fP.  If it returns NULL, this is an out of memory condition.
