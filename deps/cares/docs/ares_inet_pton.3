.TH ARES_INET_PTON 3 "17 Feb 2013"
.SH NAME
ares_inet_pton \- convert an IPv4 or IPv6 address from text to binary form
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_inet_pton(int \fIaf\fP, const char *\fIsrc\fP, void *\fIdst\fP);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a portable version with the identical functionality of the commonly
available \fIinet_pton\fP.

The ares_inet_pton() function converts the address in its standard text
presentation form into its numeric binary form. The \fBaf\fP argument shall
specify the family of the address. The AF_INET and AF_INET6 address families
shall be supported. The \fBsrc\fP argument points to the string being passed
in. The \fBdst\fP argument points to a buffer into which the function stores
the numeric address; this shall be large enough to hold the numeric address
(32 bits for AF_INET, 128 bits for AF_INET6).

It returns 1 if the address was valid for the specified address family, or 0
if the address was not parseable in the specified address family, or -1 if
some system error occurred (in which case errno will have been set).
