.TH ARES_MKQUERY 3 "20 Nov 2009"
.SH NAME
ares_mkquery \- Compose a single-question DNS query buffer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <ares.h>

int ares_mkquery(const char *\fIname\fP, int \fIdnsclass\fP, int \fItype\fP,
                 unsigned short \fIid\fP, int \fIrd\fP, unsigned char **\fIbuf\fP,
                 int *\fIbuflen\fP)
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Deprecated function. See \fIares_create_query(3)\fP instead!

The
.B ares_mkquery
function composes a DNS query with a single question.
The parameter
.I name
gives the query name as a NUL-terminated C string of period-separated
labels optionally ending with a period; periods and backslashes within
a label must be escaped with a backlash.  The parameters
.I dnsclass
and
.I type
give the class and type of the query using the values defined in
.BR <arpa/nameser.h> .
The parameter
.I id
gives a 16-bit identifier for the query.  The parameter
.I rd
should be nonzero if recursion is desired, zero if not.  The query
will be placed in an allocated buffer, a pointer to which will be
stored in the variable pointed to by
.IR buf ,
and the length of which will be stored in the variable pointed to by
.IR buflen .
It is the caller's responsibility to free this buffer using
\fIares_free_string(3)\fP when it is no longer needed.

Usage of \fIares_mkquery(3)\fP is deprecated, whereas the function is
equivalent to \fIares_create_query(3)\fP with \fBmax_udp_size\fP set to
0.

.SH RETURN VALUES
.B ares_mkquery
can return any of the following values:
.TP 15
.B ARES_SUCCESS
Construction of the DNS query succeeded.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOTFOUND
The query name
.I name
refers to a
.I .onion
domain name. See RFC 7686.
.TP 15
.B ARES_EBADNAME
The query name
.I name
could not be encoded as a domain name, either because it contained a
zero-length label or because it contained a label of more than 63
characters.
.TP 15
.B ARES_ENOMEM
Memory was exhausted.
