# Introduction

Much of the JavaScript library is implemented in JavaScript code itself,
using a minimal set of C++ runtime functions callable from JavaScript.
Some of these are called using names that start with %, and using the flag
"--allow-natives-syntax".  Others are only called by code generated by the
code generators, and are not visible in JS, even using the % syntax.

Here are the V8 runtime functions, their JS names, if they are visible,
and their documentation.
