// This file provides the Google-internal implementation of LowLevelHash.
//
// LowLevelHash is a fast hash function for hash tables, the fastest we've
// currently (late 2020) found that passes the SMHasher tests. The algorithm
// relies on intrinsic 128-bit multiplication for speed. This is not meant to be
// secure - just fast.
//
// It is closely based on a version of wyhash, but does not maintain or
// guarantee future compatibility with it.
