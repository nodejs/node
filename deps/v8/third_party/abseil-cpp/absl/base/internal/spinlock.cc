// Description of lock-word:
//  31..00: [............................3][2][1][0]
//
//     [0]: kSpinLockHeld
//     [1]: kSpinLockCooperative
//     [2]: kSpinLockDisabledScheduling
// [31..3]: ONLY kSpinLockSleeper OR
//          Wait time in cycles >> PROFILE_TIMESTAMP_SHIFT
//
// Detailed descriptions:
//
// Bit [0]: The lock is considered held iff kSpinLockHeld is set.
//
// Bit [1]: Eligible waiters (e.g. Fibers) may co-operatively reschedule when
//          contended iff kSpinLockCooperative is set.
//
// Bit [2]: This bit is exclusive from bit [1].  It is used only by a
//          non-cooperative lock.  When set, indicates that scheduling was
//          successfully disabled when the lock was acquired.  May be unset,
//          even if non-cooperative, if a ThreadIdentity did not yet exist at
//          time of acquisition.
//
// Bit [3]: If this is the only upper bit ([31..3]) set then this lock was
//          acquired without contention, however, at least one waiter exists.
//
//          Otherwise, bits [31..3] represent the time spent by the current lock
//          holder to acquire the lock.  There may be outstanding waiter(s).
