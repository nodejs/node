** instants after the last transition time stored in the file
** (with nothing between the newlines if there is no POSIX.1-2017
** representation for such instants).
**
** If tz_version is '3' or greater, the TZ string can be any POSIX.1-2024
** proleptic TZ string, which means the above is extended as follows.
** First, the TZ string's hour offset may range from -167
** through 167 as compared to the range 0 through 24 required
** by POSIX.1-2017 and earlier.
** Second, its DST start time may be January 1 at 00:00 and its stop
** time December 31 at 24:00 plus the difference between DST and
** standard time, indicating DST all year.
