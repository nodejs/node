Description:
A fast hash function.

This is a fork of upstream, with the parts that we don't need or want
removed.  We do not intend to sync regularly with upstream git. This
particular version is copied over from Chromium.

Local Modifications:
- Copied over from Chromium's third_party/rapidhash with all its changes.
- Removed base/ includes and replaced with V8 versions.
