Description:
JsonCpp is used by multiple projects for parsing and generating JSON data. This
project is mirrored here from the public GitHub project, with a custom BUILD.gn
to allow for building with our Ninja + GN configuration. The main project uses
Meson or CMake for building.

Note: to update this project to a new version, regenerating the version.h header
is required. This can be done by installing either CMake or Meson, building the
project, and copying the generated version.h to the generated/ subfolder.
