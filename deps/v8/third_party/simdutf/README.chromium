Description:
This library provide fast Unicode functions such as:
- WHATWG forgiving-base64 (with or without URL encoding) to binary,
- Binary to base64 (with or without URL encoding),
- etc.
The functions are accelerated using SIMD instructions (e.g., ARM NEON, SSE, AVX,
AVX-512, RISC-V Vector Extension, etc.). When your strings contain hundreds of
characters, we can often transcode them at speeds exceeding a billion characters
per second.

This library is written in C++, which is memory unsafe, so it can only be
used for trustworthy data or in sandboxed processes, like the renderer process.
For new uses of base64 involving untrustworthy data in unsandboxed processes,
a memory-safe alternative should be used.

Note: This is using the single header version of the library. To update it,
download the single-header file from their released page, and replace the
files in this directory.
