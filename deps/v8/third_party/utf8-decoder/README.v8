Description:
Decodes UTF-8 bytes using a fast and simple definite finite automata.

Local modifications:
- Rejection state has been mapped to row 0 (instead of row 1) of the DFA,
  saving some 50 bytes and making the table easier to reason about.
- The transitions have been remapped to represent both a state transition and a
  bit mask for the incoming byte.
- The caller must now zero out the code point buffer after successful or
  unsuccessful state transitions.
- Specifically for generalized-utf8-decoder.h: we adapt the original
  decoder to decode and validate "generalized UTF-8", a variant of UTF-8
  used in WTF-8 that can encode surrogates.  See
  https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/#generalized-utf8.  There is one
  fewer state and so the transition table is smaller by one in both
  dimensions.
