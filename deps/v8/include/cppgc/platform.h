   * Posts `job_task` to run in parallel. Returns a `JobHandle` associated with
   * the `Job`, which can be joined or canceled.
   * This avoids degenerate cases:
   * - Calling `CallOnWorkerThread()` for each work item, causing significant
   *   overhead.
   * - Fixed number of `CallOnWorkerThread()` calls that split the work and
   *   might run for a long time. This is problematic when many components post
   *   "num cores" tasks and all expect to use all the cores. In these cases,
   *   the scheduler lacks context to be fair to multiple same-priority requests
   *   and/or ability to request lower priority work to yield when high priority
   *   work comes in.
   * A canonical implementation of `job_task` looks like:
   * \code
   * class MyJobTask : public JobTask {
   *  public:
   *   MyJobTask(...) : worker_queue_(...) {}
   *   // JobTask implementation.
   *   void Run(JobDelegate* delegate) override {
   *     while (!delegate->ShouldYield()) {
   *       // Smallest unit of work.
   *       auto work_item = worker_queue_.TakeWorkItem(); // Thread safe.
   *       if (!work_item) return;
   *       ProcessWork(work_item);
   *     }
   *   }
   *
   *   size_t GetMaxConcurrency() const override {
   *     return worker_queue_.GetSize(); // Thread safe.
   *   }
   * };
   *
   * // ...
   * auto handle = PostJob(TaskPriority::kUserVisible,
   *                       std::make_unique<MyJobTask>(...));
   * handle->Join();
   * \endcode
   *
   * `PostJob()` and methods of the returned JobHandle/JobDelegate, must never
   * be called while holding a lock that could be acquired by `JobTask::Run()`
   * or `JobTask::GetMaxConcurrency()` -- that could result in a deadlock. This
   * is because (1) `JobTask::GetMaxConcurrency()` may be invoked while holding
   * internal lock (A), hence `JobTask::GetMaxConcurrency()` can only use a lock
   * (B) if that lock is *never* held while calling back into `JobHandle` from
   * any thread (A=>B/B=>A deadlock) and (2) `JobTask::Run()` or
   * `JobTask::GetMaxConcurrency()` may be invoked synchronously from
   * `JobHandle` (B=>JobHandle::foo=>B deadlock).
   *
   * A sufficient `PostJob()` implementation that uses the default Job provided
   * in libplatform looks like:
   * \code
   * std::unique_ptr<JobHandle> PostJob(
   *     TaskPriority priority, std::unique_ptr<JobTask> job_task) override {
   *   return std::make_unique<DefaultJobHandle>(
   *       std::make_shared<DefaultJobState>(
   *           this, std::move(job_task), kNumThreads));
