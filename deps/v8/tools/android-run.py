# This script executes the passed command line on Android device
# using 'adb shell' command. Unfortunately, 'adb shell' always
# returns exit code 0, ignoring the exit code of executed command.
# Since we need to return non-zero exit code if the command failed,
# we augment the passed command line with exit code checking statement
# and output special error string in case of non-zero exit code.
# Then we parse the output of 'adb shell' and look for that error string.

# for py2/py3 compatibility
