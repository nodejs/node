This test makes sure we don't hang when setting cyclic prototype values: http://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6985

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS o1.__proto__ = o3; threw exception TypeError: Cyclic __proto__ value.
PASS ({}).hasOwnProperty.call(o1, '__proto__') is false
PASS ({}).hasOwnProperty.call(o1, '__proto__') is true
PASS Object.getPrototypeOf(o1) is null
PASS successfullyParsed is true
