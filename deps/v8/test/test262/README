This directory contains code for binding the test262 test suite
into the v8 test harness. The tests are checked out as a dependency from

  https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/tc39/test262

at a revision specified in the DEPS file as 'data' in this directory. They are
fetched with 'gclient sync'. To update to a newer version, please change the
DEPS file.

Using a newer version, e.g. 'deadbeef' may be possible but the tests are only
known to pass (and indeed run) with the DEPS revision. Example:

  cd data
  git fetch
  git checkout deadbeef

If you do update to a newer revision you may have to change the test
harness adapter code since it uses internal functionality from the
harness that comes bundled with the tests.  You will most likely also
have to update the test expectation file.
