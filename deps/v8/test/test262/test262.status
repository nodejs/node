##################### DELIBERATE INCOMPATIBILITIES #####################

# We deliberately treat arguments to parseInt() with a leading zero as
# octal numbers in order to not break the web.
S15.1.2.2_A5.1_T1: FAIL_OK

# This tests precision of Math.tan and Math.sin.  The implementation for those
# trigonometric functions are platform/compiler dependent.  Furthermore, the
# expectation values by far deviates from the actual result given by an
# arbitrary-precision calculator, making those tests partly bogus.

# We are more lenient in which string character escapes we allow than
# the spec (7.8.4 p. 19) wants us to be.  This is for compatibility.

# Linux for ia32 (and therefore simulators) default to extended 80 bit floating
# point formats, so these tests checking 64-bit FP precision fail. The other
# platforms/arch's pass these tests.
# We follow the other major JS engines by keeping this default.

############################ INVALID TESTS #############################

# The reference value calculated by Test262 is incorrect if you run these tests
