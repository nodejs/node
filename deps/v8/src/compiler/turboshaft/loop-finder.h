  // This analyzer finds which loop each Block of a graph belongs to, and
  // computes a list of all of the loops headers.
  //
  // A block is considered to "belong to a loop" if there is a forward-path (ie,
  // without taking backedges) from this block to the backedge of the loop.
  //
  // This analysis runs in O(number of blocks), iterating each block once, and
  // iterating blocks that are in a loop twice.
  //
  // Implementation:
  // LoopFinder::Run walks the blocks of the graph backwards, and when it
  // reaches a LoopHeader, it calls LoopFinder::VisitLoop.
  // LoopFinder::VisitLoop iterates all of the blocks of the loop backwards,
  // starting from the backedge, and stopping upon reaching the loop header. It
  // marks the blocks that don't have a `parent_loops_` set as being part of the
  // current loop (= sets their `parent_loops_` to the current loop header). If
  // it finds a block that already has a `parent_loops_` set, it means that this
  // loop contains an inner loop, so we skip this inner block as set the
  // `has_inner_loops` bit.
  //
  // By iterating the blocks backwards in Run, we are guaranteed that inner
  // loops are visited before their outer loops. Walking the graph forward
  // doesn't work quite as nicely:
  //  - When seeing loop headers for the 1st time, we wouldn't have visited
  //    their inner loops yet.
  //  - If we decided to still iterate forward but to call VisitLoop when
  //    reaching their backedge rather than their header, it would work in most
  //    cases but not all, since the backedge of an outer loop can have a
  //    BlockIndex that is smaller than the one of an inner loop.
