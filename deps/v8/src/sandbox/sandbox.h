/**
 * The V8 Sandbox.
 *
 * When enabled, V8 reserves a large region of virtual address space - the
 * sandbox - and places most of its objects inside of it. It is then assumed
 * that an attacker can, by exploiting a vulnerability in V8, corrupt memory
 * inside the sandbox arbitrarily and from different threads. The sandbox
 * attempts to stop an attacker from corrupting other memory in the process.
 *
 * The sandbox relies on a number of different mechanisms to achieve its goal.
 * For example, objects inside the sandbox can reference each other through
 * offsets from the start of the sandbox ("sandboxed pointers") instead of raw
 * pointers, and external objects can be referenced through indices into a
 * per-Isolate table of external pointers ("sandboxed external pointers").
 *
 * The pointer compression region, which contains most V8 objects, and inside
 * of which compressed (32-bit) pointers are used, is located at the start of
 * the sandbox. The remainder of the sandbox is mostly used for memory
 * buffers, in particular ArrayBuffer backing stores and WASM memory cages.
 *
 * As the embedder is responsible for providing ArrayBuffer allocators, V8
 * exposes the virtual address space backing the sandbox to the embedder.
