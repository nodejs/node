 * A table containing pointers to Code.

 * code pointer table entry contains both a pointer to a Code object as well as
 * a pointer to the entrypoint. This way, the performance sensitive code paths
 * that for example call a JSFunction can directly load the entrypoint from the
 * table without having to load it from the Code object.
 *
 * When the sandbox is enabled, a code pointer table (CPT) is used to ensure
 * basic control-flow integrity in the absence of special hardware support
 * (such as landing pad instructions): by referencing code through an index
 * into a CPT, and ensuring that only valid code entrypoints are stored inside
 * the table, it is then guaranteed that any indirect control-flow transfer
 * ends up on a valid entrypoint as long as an attacker is still confined to
 * the sandbox.
