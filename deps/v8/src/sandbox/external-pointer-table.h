/**
 * A table storing pointers to objects outside the V8 heap.
 *
 * When V8_ENABLE_SANDBOX, its primary use is for pointing to objects outside
 * the sandbox, as described below.
 * When V8_COMPRESS_POINTERS, external pointer tables are also used to ease
 * alignment requirements in heap object fields via indirection.
 *
 * A table's role for the V8 Sandbox:
 * --------------------------------
 * An external pointer table provides the basic mechanisms to ensure
 * memory-safe access to objects located outside the sandbox, but referenced
 * from within it. When an external pointer table is used, objects located
 * inside the sandbox reference outside objects through indices into the table.
 *
 * Type safety can be ensured by using type-specific tags for the external
 * pointers. These tags will be ORed into the unused top bits of the pointer
 * when storing them and will be ANDed away when loading the pointer later
 * again. If a pointer of the wrong type is accessed, some of the top bits will
 * remain in place, rendering the pointer inaccessible.
 *
 * Temporal memory safety is achieved through garbage collection of the table,
 * which ensures that every entry is either an invalid pointer or a valid
 * pointer pointing to a live object.
 *
 * Spatial memory safety can, if necessary, be ensured either by storing the
 * size of the referenced object together with the object itself outside the
 * sandbox, or by storing both the pointer and the size in one (double-width)
 * table entry.
 *
 * Table memory management:
 * ------------------------
 * The garbage collection algorithm works as follows:
 *  - One bit of every entry is reserved for the marking bit.
 *  - Every store to an entry automatically sets the marking bit when ORing
 *    with the tag. This avoids the need for write barriers.
 *  - Every load of an entry automatically removes the marking bit when ANDing
 *    with the inverted tag.
 *  - When the GC marking visitor finds a live object with an external pointer,
 *    it marks the corresponding entry as alive through Mark(), which sets the
 *    marking bit using an atomic CAS operation.
 *  - When marking is finished, SweepAndCompact() iterates over a Space once
 *    while the mutator is stopped and builds a freelist from all dead entries
 *    while also possibly clearing the marking bit from any live entry.
 *
 * Generational collection for tables:
 * -----------------------------------
 * Young-generation objects with external pointer slots allocate their
 * ExternalPointerTable entries in a spatially partitioned young external
 * pointer space.  There are two different mechanisms:
 *  - When using the semi-space nursery, promoting an object evacuates its EPT
 *    entries to the old external pointer space.
 *  - For the in-place MinorMS nursery, possibly-concurrent marking populates
 *    the SURVIVOR_TO_EXTERNAL_POINTER remembered sets.  In the pause, promoted
 *    objects use this remembered set to evacuate their EPT entries to the old
 *    external pointer space.  Survivors have their EPT entries are left in
 *    place.
 * In a full collection, segments from the young EPT space are eagerly promoted
 * during the pause, leaving the young generation empty.
 *
 * Table compaction:
 * -----------------
 * Additionally, the external pointer table supports compaction.
 * For details about the compaction algorithm see the
 * CompactibleExternalEntityTable class.
