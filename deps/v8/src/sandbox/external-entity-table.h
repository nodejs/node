/**
 * A thread-safe table with a fixed maximum size for storing references to
 * objects located outside of the sandbox.
 *
 * An external entity table provides the basic mechanisms to ensure
 * safe access to objects located outside the sandbox, but referenced
 * from within it. When an external entity table is used, objects located
 * inside the sandbox reference outside objects through indices into the table.
 *
 * The ExternalEntityTable class should be seen an an incomplete class that
 * needs to be extended by a concrete implementation class, such as the
 * ExternalPointerTable class, as it is lacking some functionality. In
 * particular, while the ExternalEntityTable implements basic table memory
 * management as well as entry allocation routines, it does not implement any
 * logic for reclaiming entries such as garbage collection. This must be done
 * by the child classes.
 *
 * For the purpose of memory management, the table is partitioned into Segments
 * (for example 64kb memory chunks) that are grouped together in "Spaces". All
 * segments in a space share a freelist, and so entry allocation and garbage
 * collection happen on the level of spaces.
