// Indirect pointers.
//
// An indirect pointer references a HeapObject (like a tagged pointer), but
// does so through a pointer table indirection. Indirect pointers are used when
// the sandbox is enabled to reference objects _outside_ of the sandbox in a
// memory-safe way. For that, each indirect pointer has an associated
// IndirectPointerTag which encodes the type of the referenced object. The
// pointer table indirection then ensures that the tag of the entry in the
// table matches the type of the referenced object, or else the pointer will be
// invalid (it cannot be dereferenced).

// Initialize the 'self' indirect pointer that contains a reference back to the
// owning object through its pointer table entry. For Code objects, this will
// allocate an entry in the code pointer table. For all other trusted objects,
// this will allocate an entry in the trusted pointer table.
//
// Only available when the sandbox is enabled.
