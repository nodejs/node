/**
 * An intermediate table class that abstracts garbage collection mechanism
 * for pointer tables that support compaction.
 *
 * Table compaction:
 * -----------------
 * The table's spaces are to some degree self-compacting: since the freelists
 * are sorted in ascending order, segments at the start of the table will
 * usually be fairly well utilized, while later segments might become
 * completely free, in which case they will be deallocated.
 * However, as a single live entry may keep an entire segment alive, the
 * following simple algorithm is used to compact a space if that is deemed
 * necessary:
 *  - At the start of the GC marking phase, determine if a space needs to be
 *    compacted. This decision is mostly based on the absolute and relative
 *    size of the freelist.
 *  - If compaction is needed, this algorithm determines by how many segments
 *    it would like to shrink the space (N). It will then attempts to move all
 *    live entries out of these segments so that they can be deallocated
 *    afterwards during sweeping.
 *  - The algorithm then simply selects the last N segments for evacuation, and
 *    it "marks" them for evacuation simply by remembering the start of the
 *    first selected segment. Everything after this threshold value then
 *    becomes the evacuation area. In this way, it becomes very cheap to test
 *    if an entry or segment should be evacuated: only a single integer
 *    comparison against the threshold is required. It also establishes a
 *    simple compaction invariant: compaction always moves an entry at or above
 *    the threshold to a new position before the threshold.
 *  - During marking, whenever a live entry inside the evacuation area is
 *    found, a new "evacuation entry" is allocated from the freelist (which is
 *    assumed to have enough free slots) and the address of the handle in the
 *    object owning the table entry is written into it.
 *  - During sweeping, these evacuation entries are resolved: the content of
 *    the old entry is copied into the new entry and the handle in the object
 *    is updated to point to the new entry.
 *
 * When compacting, it is expected that the evacuation area contains few live
 * entries and that the freelist will be able to serve all evacuation entry
 * allocations. In that case, compaction is essentially free (very little
 * marking overhead, no memory overhead). However, it can happen that the
 * application allocates a large number of table entries during marking, in
 * which case we might end up allocating new entries inside the evacuation area
 * or even allocate entire new segments for the space that's being compacted.
 * If that situation is detected, compaction is aborted during marking.
 *
 * This algorithm assumes that table entries (except for the null entry) are
 * never shared between multiple objects. Otherwise, the following could
 * happen: object A initially has handle H1 and is scanned during incremental
 * marking. Next, object B with handle H2 is scanned and marked for
 * evacuation. Afterwards, object A copies the handle H2 from object B.
 * During sweeping, only object B's handle will be updated to point to the
 * new entry while object A's handle is now dangling. If shared entries ever
 * become necessary, setting pointer handles would have to be guarded by
 * write barriers to avoid this scenario.
