// We piggyback on marking to compute object sizes per native context that is
// needed for the new memory measurement API. The algorithm works as follows:
// 1) At the start of marking we create a marking worklist for each context.
//    The existing shared, on_hold, and embedder worklists continue to work
//    as they did before, but they hold objects that are not attributed to any
//    context yet.
// 2) Each marker has an active worklist where it pushes newly discovered
//    objects. Initially the shared worklist is set as active for all markers.
// 3) When a marker pops an object from the active worklist:
//    a) It checks if the object has a known context (e.g. JSObjects, Maps,
//       Contexts know the context they belong to). If that's the case, then
//       the marker changes its active worklist to the worklist corresponding
//       to the context of the object.
//    b) It account the size of object to the active context.
//    c) It visits all pointers in the object and pushes new objects onto the
//       active worklist.
// 4) When the active worklist becomes empty the marker selects any other
//    non-empty worklist as the active worklist.
// 5) The write barrier pushes onto the shared worklist.
//
// The main invariant for context worklists:
//    If object X is in the worklist of context C, then either
//    a) X has a context and that context is C.
//    b) X is retained by object Y that has context C.
//
// The algorithm allows us to attribute context-independent objects such as
// strings, numbers, FixedArrays to their retaining contexts. The algorithm is
// not precise for context-independent objects that are shared between multiple
// contexts. Such objects may be attributed to any retaining context.
