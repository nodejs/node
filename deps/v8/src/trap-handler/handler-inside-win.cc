// This file implements the out of bounds trap handler for
// WebAssembly. Exception handlers are notoriously difficult to get
// right, and getting it wrong can lead to security
// vulnerabilities. In order to minimize this risk, here are some
// rules to follow.
//
// 1. Do not introduce any new external dependencies. This file needs
//    to be self contained so it is easy to audit everything that a
//    trap handler might do.
//
// 2. Any changes must be reviewed by someone from the crash reporting
//    or security team. See OWNERS for suggested reviewers.
//
// For more information, see https://goo.gl/yMeyUY.
//
// This file contains most of the code that actually runs in an exception
// handler context. Some additional code is used both inside and outside the
// trap handler. This code can be found in handler-shared.cc.
