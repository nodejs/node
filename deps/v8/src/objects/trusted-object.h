// An object that is trusted to not have been modified in a malicious way.

// Typical examples of trusted objects are containers for bytecode or code
// metadata, which often allow an attacker to corrupt (for example) stack
// memory when manipulated. When the sandbox is enabled, trusted objects are
// located outside of the sandbox (in one of the trusted heap spaces) so that
// attackers cannot corrupt these objects and use them to escape from the
// sandbox. When the sandbox is disabled, trusted objects are treated like any
// other objects since in that case, many other types of objects (for example
// ArrayBuffers) can be used to corrupt memory outside of V8's heaps as well.
//
// Trusted objects cannot directly be referenced from untrusted objects as this
// would be unsafe: an attacker could corrupt any (direct) pointer to these
// objects stored inside the sandbox. However, ExposedTrustedObject can be
// referenced via indirect pointers, which guarantee memory-safe access.

// A trusted object that can safely be referenced from untrusted objects.
//
// These objects live in trusted space but are "exposed" to untrusted objects
// living inside the sandbox. They still cannot be referenced through "direct"
// pointers (these can be corrupted by an attacker), but instead they must be
// referenced through "indirect pointers": an index into a pointer table that
// contains the actual pointer as well as a type tag. This mechanism then
// guarantees memory-safe access.
//
// We want to have one pointer table entry per referenced object, *not* per
// reference. As such, there must be a way to obtain an existing table entry
// for a given (exposed) object. This base class provides that table entry in
// the form of the 'self' indirect pointer.
//
// The need to inherit from this base class to make a trusted object accessible
// means that it is not possible to expose existing utility objects such as
// hash tables or fixed arrays. Instead, those would need to be "wrapped" by
// another ExposedTrustedObject. This limitation is by design: if we were to
// create such an exposed utility object, it would likely weaken the
// type-safety mechanism of indirect pointers because indirect pointers are
// (effectively) tagged with the target's instance type. As such, if the same
// object type is used in different contexts, they would both use the same type
// tag, allowing an attacker to perform a "substitution attack". As a concrete
// example, consider the case of a trusted, exposed byte array. If such a byte
// array is used (a) to hold some sort of bytecode for an interpreter and (b)
// some sort of trusted metadata, then an attacker can take a trusted byte
// array from context (a) and use it in context (b) or vice versa. This would
// effectively result in a type confusion and likely lead to an escape from the
// sandbox. This problem goes away if (a) and (b) each use a dedicated object
// with a unique instance type. It is of course still possible to build new
// utility objects on top of this class, but hopefully this comment serves to
// document the potential pitfalls when doing so.
