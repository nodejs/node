// FreeSpace are fixed-size free memory blocks used by the heap and GC.
// They look like heap objects (are heap object tagged and have a map) so that
// the heap remains iterable.  They have a size and a next pointer.
// The next pointer is the raw address of the next FreeSpace object (or NULL)
// in the free list.
//
// When external code space is enabled next pointer is stored as Smi values
// representing a diff from current FreeSpace object address in kObjectAlignment
// chunks. Terminating FreeSpace value is represented as Smi zero.
// Such a representation has the following properties:
// a) it can hold both positive an negative diffs for full pointer compression
//    cage size (HeapObject address has only valuable 30 bits while Smis have
//    31 bits),
// b) it's independent of the pointer compression base and pointer compression
//    scheme.
