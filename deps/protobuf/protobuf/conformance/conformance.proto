// This defines the conformance testing protocol.  This protocol exists between
// the conformance test suite itself and the code being tested.  For each test,
// the suite will send a ConformanceRequest message and expect a
// ConformanceResponse message.
//
// You can either run the tests in two different ways:
//
//   1. in-process (using the interface in conformance_test.h).
//
//   2. as a sub-process communicating over a pipe.  Information about how to
//      do this is in conformance_test_runner.cc.
//
// Pros/cons of the two approaches:
//
//   - running as a sub-process is much simpler for languages other than C/C++.
//
//   - running as a sub-process may be more tricky in unusual environments like
//     iOS apps, where fork/stdin/stdout are not available.
