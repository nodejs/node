1 What is libffi?
*****************

Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the "calling convention".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.  The calling convention is also sometimes called the "ABI" or
"Application Binary Interface".  

   Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

   The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

   FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.

2.1 The Basics
==============

`Libffi' assumes that you have a pointer to the function you wish to
call and that you know the number and types of arguments to pass it, as
well as the return type of the function.

   The first thing you must do is create an `ffi_cif' object that
matches the signature of the function you wish to call.  This is a
separate step because it is common to make multiple calls using a
single `ffi_cif'.  The "cif" in `ffi_cif' stands for Call InterFace.
To prepare a call interface object, use the function `ffi_prep_cif'.  

 -- Function: ffi_status ffi_prep_cif (ffi_cif *CIF, ffi_abi ABI,
          unsigned int NARGS, ffi_type *RTYPE, ffi_type **ARGTYPES)
     This initializes CIF according to the given parameters.

     ABI is the ABI to use; normally `FFI_DEFAULT_ABI' is what you
     want.  *Note Multiple ABIs:: for more information.

     NARGS is the number of arguments that this function accepts.

     RTYPE is a pointer to an `ffi_type' structure that describes the
     return type of the function.  *Note Types::.

     ARGTYPES is a vector of `ffi_type' pointers.  ARGTYPES must have
     NARGS elements.  If NARGS is 0, this argument is ignored.

     `ffi_prep_cif' returns a `libffi' status code, of type
     `ffi_status'.  This will be either `FFI_OK' if everything worked
     properly; `FFI_BAD_TYPEDEF' if one of the `ffi_type' objects is
     incorrect; or `FFI_BAD_ABI' if the ABI parameter is invalid.

   If the function being called is variadic (varargs) then
`ffi_prep_cif_var' must be used instead of `ffi_prep_cif'.

 -- Function: ffi_status ffi_prep_cif_var (ffi_cif *CIF, ffi_abi ABI,
          unsigned int NFIXEDARGS, unsigned int NTOTALARGS, ffi_type
          *RTYPE, ffi_type **ARGTYPES)
     This initializes CIF according to the given parameters for a call
     to a variadic function.  In general its operation is the same as
     for `ffi_prep_cif' except that:

     NFIXEDARGS is the number of fixed arguments, prior to any variadic
     arguments.  It must be greater than zero.

     NTOTALARGS the total number of arguments, including variadic and
     fixed arguments.  ARGTYPES must have this many elements.

     Note that, different cif's must be prepped for calls to the same
     function when different numbers of arguments are passed.

     Also note that a call to `ffi_prep_cif_var' with
     NFIXEDARGS=NOTOTALARGS is NOT equivalent to a call to
     `ffi_prep_cif'.


   Note that the resulting `ffi_cif' holds pointers to all the
`ffi_type' objects that were used during initialization.  You must
ensure that these type objects have a lifetime at least as long as that
of the `ffi_cif'.

   To call a function using an initialized `ffi_cif', use the
`ffi_call' function:

 -- Function: void ffi_call (ffi_cif *CIF, void *FN, void *RVALUE, void
          **AVALUES)
     This calls the function FN according to the description given in
     CIF.  CIF must have already been prepared using `ffi_prep_cif'.

     RVALUE is a pointer to a chunk of memory that will hold the result
     of the function call.  This must be large enough to hold the
     result, no smaller than the system register size (generally 32 or
     64 bits), and must be suitably aligned; it is the caller's
     responsibility to ensure this.  If CIF declares that the function
     returns `void' (using `ffi_type_void'), then RVALUE is ignored.

     In most situations, `libffi' will handle promotion according to
     the ABI.  However, for historical reasons, there is a special case
     with return values that must be handled by your code.  In
     particular, for integral (not `struct') types that are narrower
     than the system register size, the return value will be widened by
     `libffi'.  `libffi' provides a type, `ffi_arg', that can be used
     as the return type.  For example, if the CIF was defined with a
     return type of `char', `libffi' will try to store a full `ffi_arg'
     into the return value.

     AVALUES is a vector of `void *' pointers that point to the memory
     locations holding the argument values for a call.  If CIF declares
     that the function has no arguments (i.e., NARGS was 0), then
     AVALUES is ignored.  Note that argument values may be modified by
     the callee (for instance, structs passed by value); the burden of
     copying pass-by-value arguments is placed on the caller.

     Note that while the return value must be register-sized, arguments
     should exactly match their declared type.  For example, if an
     argument is a `short', then the entry in AVALUES should point to an
     object declared as `short'; but if the return type is `short',
     then RVALUE should point to an object declared as a larger type -
     usually `ffi_arg'.

2.2 Simple Example
==================

Here is a trivial example that calls `puts' a few times.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <ffi.h>

     int main()
     {
       ffi_cif cif;
       ffi_type *args[1];
       void *values[1];
       char *s;
       ffi_arg rc;

       /* Initialize the argument info vectors */
       args[0] = &ffi_type_pointer;
       values[0] = &s;

       /* Initialize the cif */
       if (ffi_prep_cif(&cif, FFI_DEFAULT_ABI, 1,
     		       &ffi_type_sint, args) == FFI_OK)
         {
           s = "Hello World!";
           ffi_call(&cif, puts, &rc, values);
           /* rc now holds the result of the call to puts */

           /* values holds a pointer to the function's arg, so to
              call puts() again all we need to do is change the
              value of s */
           s = "This is cool!";
           ffi_call(&cif, puts, &rc, values);
         }

       return 0;
     }

File: libffi.info,  Node: Primitive Types,  Next: Structures,  Up: Types

2.3.1 Primitive Types
---------------------

`Libffi' provides a number of built-in type descriptors that can be
used to describe argument and return types:

`ffi_type_void'
     The type `void'.  This cannot be used for argument types, only for
     return values.

`ffi_type_uint8'
     An unsigned, 8-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_sint8'
     A signed, 8-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_uint16'
     An unsigned, 16-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_sint16'
     A signed, 16-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_uint32'
     An unsigned, 32-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_sint32'
     A signed, 32-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_uint64'
     An unsigned, 64-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_sint64'
     A signed, 64-bit integer type.

`ffi_type_float'
     The C `float' type.

`ffi_type_double'
     The C `double' type.

`ffi_type_uchar'
     The C `unsigned char' type.

`ffi_type_schar'
     The C `signed char' type.  (Note that there is not an exact
     equivalent to the C `char' type in `libffi'; ordinarily you should
     either use `ffi_type_schar' or `ffi_type_uchar' depending on
     whether `char' is signed.)

`ffi_type_ushort'
     The C `unsigned short' type.

`ffi_type_sshort'
     The C `short' type.

`ffi_type_uint'
     The C `unsigned int' type.

`ffi_type_sint'
     The C `int' type.

`ffi_type_ulong'
     The C `unsigned long' type.

`ffi_type_slong'
     The C `long' type.

`ffi_type_longdouble'
     On platforms that have a C `long double' type, this is defined.
     On other platforms, it is not.

`ffi_type_pointer'
     A generic `void *' pointer.  You should use this for all pointers,
     regardless of their real type.

`ffi_type_complex_float'
     The C `_Complex float' type.

`ffi_type_complex_double'
     The C `_Complex double' type.

`ffi_type_complex_longdouble'
     The C `_Complex long double' type.  On platforms that have a C
     `long double' type, this is defined.  On other platforms, it is
     not.

   Each of these is of type `ffi_type', so you must take the address
when passing to `ffi_prep_cif'.

2.3.2 Structures
----------------

`libffi' is perfectly happy passing structures back and forth.  You
must first describe the structure to `libffi' by creating a new
`ffi_type' object for it.

 -- Data type: ffi_type
     The `ffi_type' has the following members:
    `size_t size'
          This is set by `libffi'; you should initialize it to zero.

    `unsigned short alignment'
          This is set by `libffi'; you should initialize it to zero.

    `unsigned short type'
          For a structure, this should be set to `FFI_TYPE_STRUCT'.

    `ffi_type **elements'
          This is a `NULL'-terminated array of pointers to `ffi_type'
          objects.  There is one element per field of the struct.

          Note that `libffi' has no special support for bit-fields.  You
          must manage these manually.

   The `size' and `alignment' fields will be filled in by
`ffi_prep_cif' or `ffi_prep_cif_var', as needed.


File: libffi.info,  Node: Size and Alignment,  Next: Arrays Unions Enums,  Prev: Structures,  Up: Types

2.3.3 Size and Alignment
------------------------

`libffi' will set the `size' and `alignment' fields of an `ffi_type'
object for you.  It does so using its knowledge of the ABI.

   You might expect that you can simply read these fields for a type
that has been laid out by `libffi'.  However, there are some caveats.

   * The size or alignment of some of the built-in types may vary
     depending on the chosen ABI.

   * The size and alignment of a new structure type will not be set by
     `libffi' until it has been passed to `ffi_prep_cif' or
     `ffi_get_struct_offsets'.

   * A structure type cannot be shared across ABIs.  Instead each ABI
     needs its own copy of the structure type.

   So, before examining these fields, it is safest to pass the
`ffi_type' object to `ffi_prep_cif' or `ffi_get_struct_offsets' first.
This function will do all the needed setup.

     ffi_type *desired_type;
     ffi_abi desired_abi;
     ...
     ffi_cif cif;
     if (ffi_prep_cif (&cif, desired_abi, 0, desired_type, NULL) == FFI_OK)
       {
         size_t size = desired_type->size;
         unsigned short alignment = desired_type->alignment;
       }

   `libffi' also provides a way to get the offsets of the members of a
structure.

 -- Function: ffi_status ffi_get_struct_offsets (ffi_abi abi, ffi_type
          *struct_type, size_t *offsets)
     Compute the offset of each element of the given structure type.
     ABI is the ABI to use; this is needed because in some cases the
     layout depends on the ABI.

     OFFSETS is an out parameter.  The caller is responsible for
     providing enough space for all the results to be written - one
     element per element type in STRUCT_TYPE.  If OFFSETS is `NULL',
     then the type will be laid out but not otherwise modified.  This
     can be useful for accessing the type's size or layout, as
     mentioned above.

     This function returns `FFI_OK' on success; `FFI_BAD_ABI' if ABI is
     invalid; or `FFI_BAD_TYPEDEF' if STRUCT_TYPE is invalid in some
     way.  Note that only `FFI_STRUCT' types are valid here.


File: libffi.info,  Node: Arrays Unions Enums,  Next: Type Example,  Prev: Size and Alignment,  Up: Types

2.3.4 Arrays, Unions, and Enumerations
--------------------------------------

2.3.4.1 Arrays
..............

`libffi' does not have direct support for arrays or unions.  However,
they can be emulated using structures.

   To emulate an array, simply create an `ffi_type' using
`FFI_TYPE_STRUCT' with as many members as there are elements in the
array.

     ffi_type array_type;
     ffi_type **elements
     int i;

     elements = malloc ((n + 1) * sizeof (ffi_type *));
     for (i = 0; i < n; ++i)
       elements[i] = array_element_type;
     elements[n] = NULL;

     array_type.size = array_type.alignment = 0;
     array_type.type = FFI_TYPE_STRUCT;
     array_type.elements = elements;

   Note that arrays cannot be passed or returned by value in C -
structure types created like this should only be used to refer to
members of real `FFI_TYPE_STRUCT' objects.

   However, a phony array type like this will not cause any errors from
`libffi' if you use it as an argument or return type.  This may be
confusing.

2.3.4.2 Unions
..............

A union can also be emulated using `FFI_TYPE_STRUCT'.  In this case,
however, you must make sure that the size and alignment match the real
requirements of the union.

   One simple way to do this is to ensue that each element type is laid
out.  Then, give the new structure type a single element; the size of
the largest element; and the largest alignment seen as well.

   This example uses the `ffi_prep_cif' trick to ensure that each
element type is laid out.

     ffi_abi desired_abi;
     ffi_type union_type;
     ffi_type **union_elements;

     int i;
     ffi_type element_types[2];

     element_types[1] = NULL;

     union_type.size = union_type.alignment = 0;
     union_type.type = FFI_TYPE_STRUCT;
     union_type.elements = element_types;

     for (i = 0; union_elements[i]; ++i)
       {
         ffi_cif cif;
         if (ffi_prep_cif (&cif, desired_abi, 0, union_elements[i], NULL) == FFI_OK)
           {
             if (union_elements[i]->size > union_type.size)
               {
                 union_type.size = union_elements[i];
                 size = union_elements[i]->size;
               }
             if (union_elements[i]->alignment > union_type.alignment)
               union_type.alignment = union_elements[i]->alignment;
           }
       }

2.3.4.3 Enumerations
....................

`libffi' does not have any special support for C `enum's.  Although any
given `enum' is implemented using a specific underlying integral type,
exactly which type will be used cannot be determined by `libffi' - it
may depend on the values in the enumeration or on compiler flags such
as `-fshort-enums'.  *Note Structures unions enumerations and
bit-fields implementation: (gcc)Structures unions enumerations and
bit-fields implementation, for more information about how GCC handles
enumerations.

2.3.5 Type Example
------------------

The following example initializes a `ffi_type' object representing the
`tm' struct from Linux's `time.h'.

   Here is how the struct is defined:

     struct tm {
         int tm_sec;
         int tm_min;
         int tm_hour;
         int tm_mday;
         int tm_mon;
         int tm_year;
         int tm_wday;
         int tm_yday;
         int tm_isdst;
         /* Those are for future use. */
         long int __tm_gmtoff__;
         __const char *__tm_zone__;
     };

   Here is the corresponding code to describe this struct to `libffi':

         {
           ffi_type tm_type;
           ffi_type *tm_type_elements[12];
           int i;

           tm_type.size = tm_type.alignment = 0;
           tm_type.type = FFI_TYPE_STRUCT;
           tm_type.elements = &tm_type_elements;

           for (i = 0; i < 9; i++)
               tm_type_elements[i] = &ffi_type_sint;

           tm_type_elements[9] = &ffi_type_slong;
           tm_type_elements[10] = &ffi_type_pointer;
           tm_type_elements[11] = NULL;

           /* tm_type can now be used to represent tm argument types and
     	 return types for ffi_prep_cif() */
         }


File: libffi.info,  Node: Complex,  Next: Complex Type Example,  Prev: Type Example,  Up: Types

2.3.6 Complex Types
-------------------

`libffi' supports the complex types defined by the C99 standard
(`_Complex float', `_Complex double' and `_Complex long double' with
the built-in type descriptors `ffi_type_complex_float',
`ffi_type_complex_double' and `ffi_type_complex_longdouble'.

   Custom complex types like `_Complex int' can also be used.  An
`ffi_type' object has to be defined to describe the complex type to
`libffi'.

 -- Data type: ffi_type
    `size_t size'
          This must be manually set to the size of the complex type.

    `unsigned short alignment'
          This must be manually set to the alignment of the complex
          type.

    `unsigned short type'
          For a complex type, this must be set to `FFI_TYPE_COMPLEX'.

    `ffi_type **elements'
          This is a `NULL'-terminated array of pointers to `ffi_type'
          objects.  The first element is set to the `ffi_type' of the
          complex's base type.  The second element must be set to
          `NULL'.

   The section *Note Complex Type Example:: shows a way to determine
the `size' and `alignment' members in a platform independent way.

   For platforms that have no complex support in `libffi' yet, the
functions `ffi_prep_cif' and `ffi_prep_args' abort the program if they
encounter a complex type.

   This is an example for defining a custom complex type descriptor for
compilers that support them:

     /*

      * in a platform independent way.
      *
      * name: Name of the new descriptor is ffi_type_complex_<name>.
      * type: The C base type of the complex type.
      */
     #define FFI_COMPLEX_TYPEDEF(name, type, ffitype)             \
       static ffi_type *ffi_elements_complex_##name [2] = {      \
         (ffi_type *)(&ffitype), NULL                             \
       };                                                        \
       struct struct_align_complex_##name {                      \
         char c;                                                  \
         _Complex type x;                                         \
       };                                                        \
       ffi_type ffi_type_complex_##name = {                      \
         sizeof(_Complex type),                                   \
         offsetof(struct struct_align_complex_##name, x),         \
         FFI_TYPE_COMPLEX,                                        \
         (ffi_type **)ffi_elements_complex_##name                 \

     /* Define new complex type descriptors using the macro: */
     /* ffi_type_complex_sint */
     FFI_COMPLEX_TYPEDEF(sint, int, ffi_type_sint);
     /* ffi_type_complex_uchar */
     FFI_COMPLEX_TYPEDEF(uchar, unsigned char, ffi_type_uint8);

   The new type descriptors can then be used like one of the built-in
type descriptors in the previous example.

2.4 Multiple ABIs
=================

A given platform may provide multiple different ABIs at once.  For
instance, the x86 platform has both `stdcall' and `fastcall' functions.

   `libffi' provides some support for this.  However, this is
necessarily platform-specific.


File: libffi.info,  Node: The Closure API,  Next: Closure Example,  Prev: Multiple ABIs,  Up: Using libffi

2.5 The Closure API
===================

`libffi' also provides a way to write a generic function - a function
that can accept and decode any combination of arguments.  This can be
useful when writing an interpreter, or to provide wrappers for
arbitrary functions.

   This facility is called the "closure API".  Closures are not
supported on all platforms; you can check the `FFI_CLOSURES' define to
determine whether they are supported on the current platform.  

   Because closures work by assembling a tiny function at runtime, they
require special allocation on platforms that have a non-executable
heap.  Memory management for closures is handled by a pair of functions:

 -- Function: void *ffi_closure_alloc (size_t SIZE, void **CODE)
     Allocate a chunk of memory holding SIZE bytes.  This returns a
     pointer to the writable address, and sets *CODE to the
     corresponding executable address.

     SIZE should be sufficient to hold a `ffi_closure' object.

 -- Function: void ffi_closure_free (void *WRITABLE)
     Free memory allocated using `ffi_closure_alloc'.  The argument is
     the writable address that was returned.

   Once you have allocated the memory for a closure, you must construct
a `ffi_cif' describing the function call.  Finally you can prepare the
closure function:

 -- Function: ffi_status ffi_prep_closure_loc (ffi_closure *CLOSURE,
          ffi_cif *CIF, void (*FUN) (ffi_cif *CIF, void *RET, void
          **ARGS, void *USER_DATA), void *USER_DATA, void *CODELOC)
     Prepare a closure function.  The arguments to
     `ffi_prep_closure_loc' are:

    CLOSURE
          The address of a `ffi_closure' object; this is the writable
          address returned by `ffi_closure_alloc'.

    CIF
          The `ffi_cif' describing the function parameters.  Note that
          this object, and the types to which it refers, must be kept
          alive until the closure itself is freed.

    USER_DATA
          An arbitrary datum that is passed, uninterpreted, to your
          closure function.

    CODELOC
          The executable address returned by `ffi_closure_alloc'.

    FUN
          The function which will be called when the closure is
          invoked.  It is called with the arguments:

         CIF
               The `ffi_cif' passed to `ffi_prep_closure_loc'.

         RET
               A pointer to the memory used for the function's return
               value.

               If the function is declared as returning `void', then
               this value is garbage and should not be used.

               Otherwise, FUN must fill the object to which this points,
               following the same special promotion behavior as
               `ffi_call'.  That is, in most cases, RET points to an
               object of exactly the size of the type specified when
               CIF was constructed.  However, integral types narrower
               than the system register size are widened.  In these
               cases your program may assume that RET points to an
               `ffi_arg' object.

         ARGS
               A vector of pointers to memory holding the arguments to
               the function.

         USER_DATA
               The same USER_DATA that was passed to
               `ffi_prep_closure_loc'.

     `ffi_prep_closure_loc' will return `FFI_OK' if everything went ok,
     and one of the other `ffi_status' values on error.

     After calling `ffi_prep_closure_loc', you can cast CODELOC to the
     appropriate pointer-to-function type.

   You may see old code referring to `ffi_prep_closure'.  This function
is deprecated, as it cannot handle the need for separate writable and
executable addresses.

2.6 Closure Example
===================

A trivial example that creates a new `puts' by binding `fputs' with
`stdout'.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <ffi.h>

     /* Acts like puts with the file given at time of enclosure. */
     void puts_binding(ffi_cif *cif, void *ret, void* args[],
                       void *stream)
     {
       *(ffi_arg *)ret = fputs(*(char **)args[0], (FILE *)stream);
     }

     typedef int (*puts_t)(char *);

     int main()
     {
       ffi_cif cif;
       ffi_type *args[1];
       ffi_closure *closure;

       void *bound_puts;
       int rc;

       /* Allocate closure and bound_puts */
       closure = ffi_closure_alloc(sizeof(ffi_closure), &bound_puts);

       if (closure)
         {
           /* Initialize the argument info vectors */
           args[0] = &ffi_type_pointer;

           /* Initialize the cif */
           if (ffi_prep_cif(&cif, FFI_DEFAULT_ABI, 1,
                            &ffi_type_sint, args) == FFI_OK)
             {
               /* Initialize the closure, setting stream to stdout */
               if (ffi_prep_closure_loc(closure, &cif, puts_binding,
                                        stdout, bound_puts) == FFI_OK)
                 {
                   rc = ((puts_t)bound_puts)("Hello World!");
                   /* rc now holds the result of the call to fputs */
                 }
             }
         }

       /* Deallocate both closure, and bound_puts */
       ffi_closure_free(closure);

       return 0;
     }


File: libffi.info,  Node: Thread Safety,  Prev: Closure Example,  Up: Using libffi

2.7 Thread Safety
=================

`libffi' is not completely thread-safe.  However, many parts are, and
if you follow some simple rules, you can use it safely in a
multi-threaded program.

   * `ffi_prep_cif' may modify the `ffi_type' objects passed to it.  It
     is best to ensure that only a single thread prepares a given
     `ffi_cif' at a time.

   * On some platforms, `ffi_prep_cif' may modify the size and
     alignment of some types, depending on the chosen ABI.  On these
     platforms, if you switch between ABIs, you must ensure that there
     is only one call to `ffi_prep_cif' at a time.

     Currently the only affected platform is PowerPC and the only
     affected type is `long double'.

3 Missing Features
******************

`libffi' is missing a few features.  We welcome patches to add support
for these.

   * Variadic closures.

   * There is no support for bit fields in structures.

   * The "raw" API is undocumented.

   * The Go API is undocumented.

   Note that variadic support is very new and tested on a relatively
small number of platforms.
