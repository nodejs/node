Executing test #25 - Promise.race still returns a rejected promise if anything throws while iterating, even if resolved promises are encountered
Executing test #26 - Promise.race fulfills with the same value as the first encountered resolved promise
Executing test #27 - Promise.race fulfills with the same value as the first encountered resolved promise (promises complete async)

Executing test #36 - Promise.all fulfills with the same value as the first encountered rejected promise
Executing test #37 - Promise.all fulfills with the same value as the first encountered rejected promise (async promises)
Executing test #38 - Promise.all fulfills when all promises in iterable fulfill
Executing test #39 - Promise.all passes each element in the arguments to Promise.resolve
Executing test #40 - Promise.resolve called with a thenable calls then on the thenable
Executing test #41 - Calling promise resolve function with thenable should call thenable.then
Executing test #42 - Promise.all doesn't call then for rejected promises
Executing test #43 - Promise.all with iterator that returns no items
Executing test #44 - Simple tampering of Promise.all promise changes resolved result value
