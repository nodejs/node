        # handshake (i.e. it doesn't supply a session id) when it receives a
        # HelloRequest. This is different to the OpenSSL TLS implementation where an
        # OpenSSL client will always try an abbreviated handshake (i.e. it will supply
        # the session id). This goes all the way to commit 48ae85b6f when abbreviated
        # handshake support was first added. Neither behaviour is wrong, but the
        # discrepancy is strange. TODO: Should we harmonise the TLS and DTLS behaviour,
        # and if so, what to?
