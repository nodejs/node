# to utilize fipsld (e.g. CC=/usr/local/ssl/bin/fipsld FIPSLD_CC=gcc
# ./configure && make). But keep in mind[!] that if certified code
# resides in a shared library, then fipsld *may not* be used and
# end-developer should not modify application configuration and build
# procedures. This is because in-core fingerprint and associated
# procedures are already embedded into and executed in shared library
