To install:

	perl Makefile.PL

to construct the Makefile, then

	make test

to test the package.  If it fails any tests, please send me the output
of `make test' and `perl -V'.  I'll tell you whether it is safe to go
ahead, or I'll provide a fix.

If it passes the tests, use

	make install

to install it.
