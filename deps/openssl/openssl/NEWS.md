OpenSSL 3.5
-----------

### Major changes between OpenSSL 3.4 and OpenSSL 3.5.0 [8 Apr 2025]

OpenSSL 3.5.0 is a feature release adding significant new functionality to
OpenSSL.

This release incorporates the following potentially significant or incompatible
changes:

  * Default encryption cipher for the `req`, `cms`, and `smime` applications
    changed from `des-ede3-cbc` to `aes-256-cbc`.

  * The default TLS supported groups list has been changed to include and
    prefer hybrid PQC KEM groups. Some practically unused groups were removed
    from the default list.

  * The default TLS keyshares have been changed to offer X25519MLKEM768 and
    and X25519.

  * All `BIO_meth_get_*()` functions were deprecated.

This release adds the following new features:

  * Support for server side QUIC (RFC 9000)

  * Support for 3rd party QUIC stacks including 0-RTT support

  * Support for PQC algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA and SLH-DSA)

  * A new configuration option `no-tls-deprecated-ec` to disable support for
    TLS groups deprecated in RFC8422

  * A new configuration option `enable-fips-jitter` to make the FIPS provider
    to use the `JITTER` seed source

  * Support for central key generation in CMP

  * Support added for opaque symmetric key objects (EVP_SKEY)

  * Support for multiple TLS keyshares and improved TLS key establishment group
    configurability

  * API support for pipelining in provided cipher algorithms

Known issues in 3.5.0

  * <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/27282>
    Calling SSL_accept on objects returned from SSL_accept_connection
    results in error.  It is expected that making this call will advance
    the SSL handshake for the passed connection, but currently it does not.
    This can be handled by calling SSL_do_handshake instead.  A fix is planned
    for OpenSSL 3.5.1

OpenSSL 3.4
-----------

### Major changes between OpenSSL 3.4.0 and OpenSSL 3.4.1 [11 Feb 2025]

OpenSSL 3.4.1 is a security patch release. The most severe CVE fixed in this
release is High.

This release incorporates the following bug fixes and mitigations:

  * Fixed RFC7250 handshakes with unauthenticated servers don't abort as expected.
    ([CVE-2024-12797])

  * Fixed timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computation.
    ([CVE-2024-13176])

### Major changes between OpenSSL 3.3 and OpenSSL 3.4.0 [22 Oct 2024]

OpenSSL 3.4.0 is a feature release adding significant new functionality to
OpenSSL.

This release incorporates the following potentially significant or incompatible
changes:

  * Deprecation of TS_VERIFY_CTX_set_* functions and addition of replacement
    TS_VERIFY_CTX_set0_* functions with improved semantics

  * Redesigned use of OPENSSLDIR/ENGINESDIR/MODULESDIR on Windows such that
    what were formerly build time locations can now be defined at run time
    with registry keys

  * The X25519 and X448 key exchange implementation in the FIPS provider
    is unapproved and has `fips=no` property.

  * SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 implementations have no default digest length
    anymore. That means these algorithms cannot be used with
    EVP_DigestFinal/_ex() unless the `xoflen` param is set before.

  * Setting `config_diagnostics=1` in the config file will cause errors to
    be returned from SSL_CTX_new() and SSL_CTX_new_ex() if there is an error
    in the ssl module configuration.

  * An empty renegotiate extension will be used in TLS client hellos instead
    of the empty renegotiation SCSV, for all connections with a minimum TLS
    version > 1.0.

  * Deprecation of SSL_SESSION_get_time(), SSL_SESSION_set_time() and
    SSL_CTX_flush_sessions() functions in favor of their respective `_ex`
    functions which are Y2038-safe on platforms with Y2038-safe `time_t`

This release adds the following new features:

  * Support for directly fetched composite signature algorithms such as
    RSA-SHA2-256 including new API functions

  * FIPS indicators support in the FIPS provider and various updates of the FIPS
    provider required for future FIPS 140-3 validations

  * Implementation of RFC 9579 (PBMAC1) in PKCS#12

  * An optional additional random seed source RNG `JITTER` using a statically
    linked jitterentropy library

  * New options `-not_before` and `-not_after` for explicit setting start and
    end dates of certificates created with the `req` and `x509` apps

  * Support for integrity-only cipher suites TLS_SHA256_SHA256 and
    TLS_SHA384_SHA384 in TLS 1.3, as defined in RFC 9150

  * Support for retrieving certificate request templates and CRLs in CMP

  * Support for additional X.509v3 extensions related to Attribute Certificates

  * Initial Attribute Certificate (RFC 5755) support

  * Possibility to customize ECC groups initialization to use precomputed values
    to save CPU time and use of this feature by the P-256 implementation

  * Fixed an issue where checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may
    be very slow
    ([CVE-2024-4603])

### Major changes between OpenSSL 3.2 and OpenSSL 3.3.0 [9 Apr 2024]

OpenSSL 3.3.0 is a feature release adding significant new functionality to
OpenSSL.

This release adds the following new features:

  * Support for qlog for tracing QUIC connections has been added

  * Added APIs to allow configuring the negotiated idle timeout for QUIC
    connections, and to allow determining the number of additional streams
    that can currently be created for a QUIC connection.

  * Added APIs to allow disabling implicit QUIC event processing for QUIC SSL
    objects

  * Added APIs to allow querying the size and utilisation of a QUIC stream's
    write buffer

  * New API `SSL_write_ex2`, which can be used to send an end-of-stream (FIN)
    condition in an optimised way when using QUIC.

  * Limited support for polling of QUIC connection and stream objects in a
    non-blocking manner.

  * Added a new EVP_DigestSqueeze() API. This allows SHAKE to squeeze multiple
    times with different output sizes.

  * Added exporter for CMake on Unix and Windows, alongside the pkg-config
    exporter.

  * The BLAKE2s hash algorithm matches BLAKE2b's support for configurable
    output length.

    derivation of CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) parameters when requested

  * Added API functions SSL_SESSION_get_time_ex(), SSL_SESSION_set_time_ex()
    using time_t which is Y2038 safe on 32 bit systems when 64 bit time
    is enabled

  * Unknown entries in TLS SignatureAlgorithms, ClientSignatureAlgorithms
    config options and the respective calls to SSL[_CTX]_set1_sigalgs() and
    SSL[_CTX]_set1_client_sigalgs() that start with `?` character are
    ignored and the configuration will still be used.

  * Added `-set_issuer` and `-set_subject` options to `openssl x509` to
    override the Issuer and Subject when creating a certificate. The `-subj`
    option now is an alias for `-set_subject`.

  * Added several new features of CMPv3 defined in RFC 9480 and RFC 9483

  * New option `SSL_OP_PREFER_NO_DHE_KEX`, which allows configuring a TLS1.3
    server to prefer session resumption using PSK-only key exchange over PSK
    with DHE, if both are available.

  * New atexit configuration switch, which controls whether the OPENSSL_cleanup
    is registered when libcrypto is unloaded.

  * Added X509_STORE_get1_objects to avoid issues with the existing
    X509_STORE_get0_objects API in multi-threaded applications.

    extensions

  * Added assembly implementation for md5 on loongarch64

  * Accept longer context for TLS 1.2 exporters

  * The activate and soft_load configuration settings for providers in
    openssl.cnf have been updated to require a value of [1|yes|true|on]
    (in lower or UPPER case) to enable the setting. Conversely a value
    of [0|no|false|off] will disable the setting.

  * In `openssl speed`, changed the default hash function used with `hmac` from
    `md5` to `sha256`.

  * The `-verify` option to the `openssl crl` and `openssl req` will make the
    program exit with 1 on failure.

  * The d2i_ASN1_GENERALIZEDTIME(), d2i_ASN1_UTCTIME(), ASN1_TIME_check(), and
    related functions have been augmented to check for a minimum length of
    the input string, in accordance with ITU-T X.690 section 11.7 and 11.8.

  * OPENSSL_sk_push() and sk_<TYPE>_push() functions now return 0 instead of -1
    if called with a NULL stack argument.

  * New limit on HTTP response headers is introduced to HTTP client. The
    default limit is set to 256 header lines.

This release incorporates the following bug fixes and mitigations:

  * The BIO_get_new_index() function can only be called 127 times before it
    reaches its upper bound of BIO_TYPE_MASK and will now return -1 once its
    exhausted.
