=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to print out version information about OpenSSL.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-a>

All information, this is the same as setting all the other flags.

=item B<-v>

The current OpenSSL version.

=item B<-b>

The date the current version of OpenSSL was built.

=item B<-o>

Option information: various options set when the library was built.

=item B<-f>

Compilation flags.

=item B<-p>

Platform setting.

=item B<-d>

OPENSSLDIR setting.

=item B<-e>

ENGINESDIR settings.

=item B<-m>

MODULESDIR settings.

=item B<-r>

The random number generator source settings.

=item B<-c>

The OpenSSL CPU settings info.

=item B<-w>

The OpenSSL B<OSSL_WINCTX> build time variable, if set.
Used for computing Windows registry key names.  This option is unavailable on
non-Windows platforms.

=head1 HISTORY

In OpenSSL versions prior to 3.4, OpenSSL had a limitation regarding the
B<OPENSSLDIR>, B<MODULESDIR> and B<ENGINESDIR> build time macros.  These macros
were defined at build time, and represented filesystem paths.  This is common
practice on unix like systems, as there was an expectation that a given build
would be installed to a pre-determined location.  On Windows however, there is
no such expectation, as libraries can be installed to arbitrary locations.
B<OSSL_WINCTX> was introduced as a new build time variable to define a set of
registry keys identified by the name openssl-<version>-<ctx>, in which the
<version> value is derived from the version string in the openssl source, and
the <ctx> extension is derived from the B<OSSL_WINCTX> variable.  The values of
B<OPENSSLDIR>, B<ENGINESDIR> and B<MODULESDIR> can be set to various paths
underneath this key to break the requirement to predict the installation path at
build time.

=head1 NOTES

The output of C<openssl version -a> would typically be used when sending
in a bug report.
