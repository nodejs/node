=head1 NAME

openssl-pkeyparam - public key algorithm parameter processing command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<pkeyparam>
[B<-help>]
[B<-in> I<filename>]
[B<-out> I<filename>]
[B<-text>]
[B<-noout>]
[B<-check>]
{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_engine_synopsis -}{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_provider_synopsis -}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command processes public key algorithm parameters.
They can be checked for correctness and their components printed out.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-in> I<filename>

This specifies the input file to read parameters from or standard input if
this option is not specified.

=item B<-out> I<filename>

This specifies the output filename to write parameters to or standard output if
this option is not specified.
The output filename can be the same as the input filename,
which leads to replacing the file contents.
Note that file I/O is not atomic. The output file is truncated and then written.

=item B<-text>

Prints out the parameters in plain text in addition to the encoded version.

=item B<-noout>

Do not output the encoded version of the parameters.

=item B<-check>

This option checks the correctness of parameters.

{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_engine_item -}

{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_provider_item -}

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Print out text version of parameters:

 openssl pkeyparam -in param.pem -text

=head1 NOTES

There are no B<-inform> or B<-outform> options for this command because only
PEM format is supported because the key type is determined by the PEM headers.
