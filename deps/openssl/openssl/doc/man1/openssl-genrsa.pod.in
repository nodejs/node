=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command generates an RSA private key.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-out> I<filename>

Output the key to the specified file. If this argument is not specified then
standard output is used.

=item B<-passout> I<arg>

The output file password source. For more information about the format
see L<openssl-passphrase-options(1)>.

=item B<-aes128>, B<-aes192>, B<-aes256>, B<-aria128>, B<-aria192>, B<-aria256>, B<-camellia128>, B<-camellia192>, B<-camellia256>, B<-des>, B<-des3>, B<-idea>

These options encrypt the private key with specified
cipher before outputting it. If none of these options is
specified no encryption is used. If encryption is used a pass phrase is prompted
for if it is not supplied via the B<-passout> argument.

=item B<-F4>, B<-f4>, B<-3>

The public exponent to use, either 65537 or 3. The default is 65537.
The B<-3> option has been deprecated.

=item B<-primes> I<num>

Specify the number of primes to use while generating the RSA key. The I<num>
parameter must be a positive integer that is greater than 1 and less than 16.
If I<num> is greater than 2, then the generated key is called a 'multi-prime'
RSA key, which is defined in RFC 8017.

=item B<-verbose>

Print extra details about the operations being performed.

=item B<-quiet>

Print fewer details about the operations being performed, which may
be handy during batch scripts and pipelines.

=item B<-traditional>

Write the key using the traditional PKCS#1 format instead of the PKCS#8 format.

{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_r_item -}

{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_engine_item -}

{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_provider_item -}

=item B<numbits>

The size of the private key to generate in bits. This must be the last option
specified. The default is 2048 and values less than 512 are not allowed.

=head1 NOTES

RSA private key generation essentially involves the generation of two or more
prime numbers. When generating a private key various symbols will be output to
indicate the progress of the generation. A B<.> represents each number which
has passed an initial sieve test, B<+> means a number has passed a single
round of the Miller-Rabin primality test, B<*> means the current prime starts
a regenerating progress due to some failed tests. A newline means that the number
has passed all the prime tests (the actual number depends on the key size).

Because key generation is a random process the time taken to generate a key
may vary somewhat. But in general, more primes lead to less generation time
of a key.
