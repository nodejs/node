=head1 NAME

openssl-rand - generate pseudo-random bytes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl rand>

[B<-out> I<file>]
[B<-base64>]
[B<-hex>]

{- $OpenSSL::safe::opt_provider_synopsis -}
I<num>[K|M|G|T]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command generates I<num> random bytes using a cryptographically
secure pseudo random number generator (CSPRNG). A suffix [K|M|G|T] may be
appended to the num value to indicate the requested value be scaled as a
multiple of KiB/MiB/GiB/TiB respectively. Note that suffixes are case
sensitive, and that the suffixes represent binary multiples
(K = 1024 bytes, M = 1024*1024 bytes, etc).

The string 'max' may be substituted for a numerical value in num, to request the
maximum number of bytes the CSPRNG can produce per instantiation.  Currently,
this is restricted to 2^61 bytes as per NIST SP 800-90C.

The random bytes are generated using the L<RAND_bytes(3)> function,
which provides a security level of 256 bits, provided it managed to
seed itself successfully from a trusted operating system entropy source.
Otherwise, the command will fail with a nonzero error code.
For more details, see L<RAND_bytes(3)>, L<RAND(7)>, and L<EVP_RAND(7)>.
