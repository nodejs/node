=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions manipulate the B<X509_VERIFY_PARAM> structure associated with
a certificate verification operation. 

The X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() function sets the flags in B<param> by oring
it with B<flags>. See the B<VERIFICATION FLAGS> section for a complete
description of values the B<flags> parameter can take.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get_flags() returns the flags in B<param>.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_clear_flags() clears the flags B<flags> in B<param>.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_purpose() sets the verification purpose in B<param>
to B<purpose>. This determines the acceptable purpose of the certificate
chain, for example SSL client or SSL server.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_trust() sets the trust setting in B<param> to 
B<trust>.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_time() sets the verification time in B<param> to
B<t>. Normally the current time is used.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() enables policy checking (it is disabled
by default) and adds B<policy> to the acceptable policy set.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies() enables policy checking (it is disabled
by default) and sets the acceptable policy set to B<policies>. Any existing
policy set is cleared. The B<policies> parameter can be B<NULL> to clear
an existing policy set.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_depth() sets the maximum verification depth to B<depth>.
That is the maximum number of untrusted CA certificates that can appear in a
chain.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host() sets the expected DNS hostname to
B<name> clearing any previously specified host name or names.  If
B<name> is NULL, or empty the list of hostnames is cleared, and
name checks are not performed on the peer certificate.  If B<name>
is NUL-terminated, B<namelen> may be zero, otherwise B<namelen>
must be set to the length of B<name>.  When a hostname is specified,
certificate verification automatically invokes L<X509_check_host(3)>
with flags equal to the B<flags> argument given to
B<X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_hostflags()> (default zero).  Applications
are strongly advised to use this interface in preference to explicitly
calling L<X509_check_host(3)>, hostname checks are out of scope
with the DANE-EE(3) certificate usage, and the internal check will
be suppressed as appropriate when DANE support is added to OpenSSL.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host() adds B<name> as an additional reference
identifer that can match the peer's certificate.  Any previous names
set via X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_host() or X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add1_host()
are retained, no change is made if B<name> is NULL or empty.  When
multiple names are configured, the peer is considered verified when
any name matches.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_get0_peername() returns the DNS hostname or subject
CommonName from the peer certificate that matched one of the reference
identifiers.  When wildcard matching is not disabled, or when a
reference identifier specifies a parent domain (starts with ".")
rather than a hostname, the peer name may be a wildcard name or a
sub-domain of the reference identifier respectively.  The return
string is allocated by the library and is no longer valid once the
associated B<param> argument is freed.  Applications must not free
the return value.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_email() sets the expected RFC822 email address to
B<email>.  If B<email> is NUL-terminated, B<emaillen> may be zero, otherwise
B<emaillen> must be set to the length of B<email>.  When an email address
is specified, certificate verification automatically invokes
L<X509_check_email(3)>.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip() sets the expected IP address to B<ip>.
The B<ip> argument is in binary format, in network byte-order and
B<iplen> must be set to 4 for IPv4 and 16 for IPv6.  When an IP
address is specified, certificate verification automatically invokes
L<X509_check_ip(3)>.

X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_ip_asc() sets the expected IP address to
B<ipasc>.  The B<ipasc> argument is a NUL-terminal ASCII string:
dotted decimal quad for IPv4 and colon-separated hexadecimal for
IPv6.  The condensed "::" notation is supported for IPv6 addresses.

=head1 VERIFICATION FLAGS

The verification flags consists of zero or more of the following flags
ored together.

B<X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK> enables CRL checking for the certificate chain leaf
certificate. An error occurs if a suitable CRL cannot be found. 

B<X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL> enables CRL checking for the entire certificate
chain.

B<X509_V_FLAG_IGNORE_CRITICAL> disabled critical extension checking. By default
any unhandled critical extensions in certificates or (if checked) CRLs results
in a fatal error. If this flag is set unhandled critical extensions are
ignored. B<WARNING> setting this option for anything other than debugging
purposes can be a security risk. Finer control over which extensions are
supported can be performed in the verification callback.

THe B<X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT> flag disables workarounds for some broken
certificates and makes the verification strictly apply B<X509> rules.

B<X509_V_FLAG_ALLOW_PROXY_CERTS> enables proxy certificate verification.

B<X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK> enables certificate policy checking, by default
no policy checking is peformed. Additional information is sent to the 
verification callback relating to policy checking.

B<X509_V_FLAG_EXPLICIT_POLICY>, B<X509_V_FLAG_INHIBIT_ANY> and
B<X509_V_FLAG_INHIBIT_MAP> set the B<require explicit policy>, B<inhibit any
policy> and B<inhibit policy mapping> flags respectively as defined in
B<RFC3280>. Policy checking is automatically enabled if any of these flags
are set.

If B<X509_V_FLAG_NOTIFY_POLICY> is set and the policy checking is successful
a special status code is set to the verification callback. This permits it
to examine the valid policy tree and perform additional checks or simply
log it for debugging purposes.

By default some additional features such as indirect CRLs and CRLs signed by
different keys are disabled. If B<X509_V_FLAG_EXTENDED_CRL_SUPPORT> is set
they are enabled.

If B<X509_V_FLAG_USE_DELTAS> ise set delta CRLs (if present) are used to
determine certificate status. If not set deltas are ignored.

B<X509_V_FLAG_CHECK_SS_SIGNATURE> enables checking of the root CA self signed
cerificate signature. By default this check is disabled because it doesn't
add any additional security but in some cases applications might want to
check the signature anyway. A side effect of not checking the root CA
signature is that disabled or unsupported message digests on the root CA
are not treated as fatal errors.

The B<X509_V_FLAG_CB_ISSUER_CHECK> flag enables debugging of certificate
issuer checks. It is B<not> needed unless you are logging certificate
verification. If this flag is set then additional status codes will be sent
to the verification callback and it B<must> be prepared to handle such cases
without assuming they are hard errors.

The B<X509_V_FLAG_NO_ALT_CHAINS> flag suppresses checking for alternative
chains. By default, when building a certificate chain, if the first certificate
chain found is not trusted, then OpenSSL will continue to check to see if an
alternative chain can be found that is trusted. With this flag set the behaviour
will match that of OpenSSL versions prior to 1.0.2b.

The B<X509_V_FLAG_TRUSTED_FIRST> flag causes chain construction to look for
issuers in the trust store before looking at the untrusted certificates
provided as part of the the peer chain.
Though it is not on by default in OpenSSL 1.0.2, applications should generally
set this flag.
Local issuer certificates are often more likely to satisfy local security
requirements and lead to a locally trusted root.
This is especially important When some certificates in the trust store have
explicit trust settings (see "TRUST SETTINGS" in L<x509(1)>).

The B<X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN> flag causes intermediate certificates in the
trust store to be treated as trust-anchors, in the same way as the self-signed
root CA certificates.
This makes it possible to trust certificates issued by an intermediate CA
without having to trust its ancestor root CA.
With OpenSSL 1.0.2, chain construction continues as long as there are
additional trusted issuers in the trust store, and the last trusted issuer
becomes the trust-anchor.
Thus, even when an intermediate certificate is found in the trust store, the
verified chain passed to callbacks may still be anchored by a root CA.

=head1 NOTES

The above functions should be used to manipulate verification parameters
instead of legacy functions which work in specific structures such as
X509_STORE_CTX_set_flags().

=head1 BUGS

Delta CRL checking is currently primitive. Only a single delta can be used and
(partly due to limitations of B<X509_STORE>) constructed CRLs are not 
maintained.

If CRLs checking is enable CRLs are expected to be available in the
corresponding B<X509_STORE> structure. No attempt is made to download
CRLs from the CRL distribution points extension.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Enable CRL checking when performing certificate verification during SSL 
connections associated with an B<SSL_CTX> structure B<ctx>:

  X509_VERIFY_PARAM *param;
  param = X509_VERIFY_PARAM_new();
  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags(param, X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK);
  SSL_CTX_set1_param(ctx, param);
  X509_VERIFY_PARAM_free(param);
