                              Fingerprints

OpenSSL releases are signed with PGP/GnuPG keys.  You can find the
signatures in separate files in the same location you find the
distributions themselves.  The normal file name is the same as the
distribution file, with '.asc' added.  For example, the signature for
the distribution of OpenSSL 0.9.7f, openssl-0.9.7f.tar.gz, is found in
the file openssl-0.9.7f.tar.gz.asc.

The following is the list of fingerprints for the keys that are
currently in use (have been used since summer 2004) to sign OpenSSL
distributions:
