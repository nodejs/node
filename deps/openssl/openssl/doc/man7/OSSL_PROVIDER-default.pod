=head1 NAME

OSSL_PROVIDER-default - OpenSSL default provider

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The OpenSSL default provider supplies the majority of OpenSSL's diverse
algorithm implementations. If an application doesn't specify anything else
explicitly (e.g. in the application or via config), then this is the
provider that will be used as fallback: It is loaded automatically the
first time that an algorithm is fetched from a provider or a function
acting on providers is called and no other provider has been loaded yet.

If an attempt to load a provider has already been made (whether successful
or not) then the default provider won't be loaded automatically. Therefore
if the default provider is to be used in conjunction with other providers
then it must be loaded explicitly. Automatic loading of the default
provider only occurs a maximum of once; if the default provider is
explicitly unloaded then the default provider will not be automatically
loaded again.

=head2 Properties

The implementations in this provider specifically have this property
defined:

=over 4

=item "provider=default"

=back

It may be used in a property query string with fetching functions such as
L<EVP_MD_fetch(3)> or L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)>, as well as with other
functions that take a property query string, such as
L<EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name(3)>.

It isn't mandatory to query for this property, except to make sure to get
implementations of this provider and none other.

Some implementations may define additional properties.  Exact information is
listed below

=head2 Asymmetric Key Encoder

The default provider also includes all of the encoding algorithms
present in the base provider.  Some of these have the property "fips=yes",
to allow them to be used together with the FIPS provider.
