=head1 NAME

EVP_KDF-PBKDF1 - The PBKDF1 EVP_KDF implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing the B<PBKDF1> password-based KDF through the B<EVP_KDF>
API.

The EVP_KDF-PBKDF1 algorithm implements the PBKDF1 password-based key
derivation function, as described in RFC 8018; it derives a key from a password
using a salt and iteration count.

=head2 Identity

"PBKDF1" is the name for this implementation; it
can be used with the EVP_KDF_fetch() function.

=head2 Supported parameters

The supported parameters are:

=over 4

=item "pass" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PASSWORD>) <octet string>

=item "salt" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_SALT>) <octet string>

=item "iter" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_ITER>) <unsigned integer>

This parameter has a default value of 0 and should be set.

=item "properties" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PROPERTIES>) <UTF8 string>

=item "digest" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_DIGEST>) <UTF8 string>

These parameters work as described in L<EVP_KDF(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=back

=head1 NOTES

A typical application of this algorithm is to derive keying material for an
encryption algorithm from a password in the "pass", a salt in "salt",
and an iteration count.

Increasing the "iter" parameter slows down the algorithm which makes it
harder for an attacker to perform a brute force attack using a large number
of candidate passwords.

No assumption is made regarding the given password; it is simply treated as a
byte sequence.
