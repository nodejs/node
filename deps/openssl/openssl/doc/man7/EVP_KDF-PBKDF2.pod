=head1 NAME

EVP_KDF-PBKDF2 - The PBKDF2 EVP_KDF implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing the B<PBKDF2> password-based KDF through the B<EVP_KDF>
API.

The EVP_KDF-PBKDF2 algorithm implements the PBKDF2 password-based key
derivation function, as described in SP800-132; it derives a key from a password
using a salt and iteration count.

The output is considered to be a cryptographic key.

=head2 Identity

"PBKDF2" is the name for this implementation; it
can be used with the EVP_KDF_fetch() function.

=head2 Supported parameters

The supported parameters are:

=over 4

=item "pass" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PASSWORD>) <octet string>

=item "salt" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_SALT>) <octet string>

=item "iter" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_ITER>) <unsigned integer>

This parameter has a default value of 2048.

=item "properties" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PROPERTIES>) <UTF8 string>

=item "digest" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_DIGEST>) <UTF8 string>

These parameters work as described in L<EVP_KDF(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=item "pkcs5" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PKCS5>) <integer>

This parameter can be used to enable or disable SP800-132 compliance checks.
Setting the mode to 0 enables the compliance checks.

The checks performed are:

=over 4

=item - the iteration count is at least 1000.

=item - the salt length is at least 128 bits.

=item - the derived key length is at least 112 bits.

=back

The default provider uses a default mode of 1 for backwards compatibility,
and the FIPS provider uses a default mode of 0.
This option breaks FIPS compliance if it causes the approved "fips-indicator"
to return 0.

=item "fips-indicator" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_FIPS_APPROVED_INDICATOR>) <integer>

This option is used by the OpenSSL FIPS provider.

A getter that returns 1 if the operation is FIPS approved, or 0 otherwise.
This may be used after calling EVP_KDF_derive. It returns 0 if "pkcs5"
is set to 1 and the derived key length, salt length or iteration count test
fails.

=back

=head1 NOTES

A typical application of this algorithm is to derive keying material for an
encryption algorithm from a password in the "pass", a salt in "salt",
and an iteration count.

Increasing the "iter" parameter slows down the algorithm which makes it
harder for an attacker to perform a brute force attack using a large number
of candidate passwords.

No assumption is made regarding the given password; it is simply treated as a
byte sequence.
