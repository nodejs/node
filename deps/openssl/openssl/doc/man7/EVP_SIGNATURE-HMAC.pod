=head1 NAME

EVP_SIGNATURE-HMAC, EVP_SIGNATURE-Siphash, EVP_SIGNATURE-Poly1305,
EVP_SIGNATURE-CMAC
- The legacy B<EVP_PKEY> MAC signature implementations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The algorithms described here have legacy support for creating MACs using
L<EVP_DigestSignInit(3)> and related functions. This is not the preferred way of
creating MACs. Instead you should use the newer L<EVP_MAC_init(3)> functions.
This mechanism is provided for backwards compatibility with older versions of
OpenSSL.

The same signature parameters can be set using EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params() as can
be set via EVP_MAC_CTX_set_params() for the underlying EVP_MAC. See
L<EVP_MAC-HMAC(7)>, L<EVP_MAC-Siphash(7)>, L<EVP_MAC-Poly1305(7)> and
L<EVP_MAC-CMAC(7)> for details.

 See L<EVP_PKEY-HMAC(7)>, L<EVP_PKEY-Siphash(7)>, L<EVP_PKEY-Poly1305(7)> or
 L<EVP_PKEY-CMAC(7)> for details about parameters that are supported during the
 creation of an EVP_PKEY.
