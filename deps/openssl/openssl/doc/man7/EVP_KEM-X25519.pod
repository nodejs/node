=head1 NAME

EVP_KEM-X25519, EVP_KEM-X448
- EVP_KEM X25519 and EVP_KEM X448 keytype and algorithm support

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<X25519> and <X448> keytype and its parameters are described in
L<EVP_PKEY-X25519(7)>.
See L<EVP_PKEY_encapsulate(3)> and L<EVP_PKEY_decapsulate(3)> for more info.

=head2 X25519 and X448 KEM parameters

=over 4

=item "operation" (B<OSSL_KEM_PARAM_OPERATION>)<UTF8 string>

The OpenSSL X25519 and X448 Key Encapsulation Mechanisms only support the
following default operation (operating mode):

=over 4

=item "DHKEM" (B<OSSL_KEM_PARAM_OPERATION_DHKEM>)

The encapsulate function generates an ephemeral keypair. It produces keymaterial
by doing an X25519 or X448 key exchange using the ephemeral private key and a
supplied recipient public key. A HKDF operation using the keymaterial and a kem
context then produces a shared secret. The shared secret and the ephemeral
public key are returned.
The decapsulate function uses the recipient private key and the
ephemeral public key to produce the same keymaterial, which can then be used to
produce the same shared secret.
See L<https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9180.html#name-dh-based-kem-dhkem>

=back

This can be set using either EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_kem_op() or
EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params().

=item "ikme" (B<OSSL_KEM_PARAM_IKME>) <octet string>

Used to specify the key material used for generation of the ephemeral key.
This value should not be reused for other purposes.
It should have a length of at least 32 for X25519, and 56 for X448.
If this value is not set, then a random ikm is used.

=head1 HISTORY

This functionality was added in OpenSSL 3.2.

The C<operation> (operating mode) was a required parameter prior to OpenSSL 3.5.
As of OpenSSL 3.5, C<DHKEM> is the default operating mode, and no explicit value
need be specified.
