=head1 NAME

EVP_CIPHER-DES - The DES EVP_CIPHER implementations

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for DES symmetric encryption using the B<EVP_CIPHER> API.

=head2 Algorithm Names

The following algorithms are available in the FIPS provider as well as the
default provider:

=over 4

=item "DES-EDE3-ECB" or "DES-EDE3"

=item "DES-EDE3-CBC" or "DES3"

=back

The following algorithms are available in the default provider, but not the
FIPS provider:

=over 4

=item "DES-EDE3-CFB8" and "DES-EDE3-CFB1"

=item "DES-EDE-ECB" or "DES-EDE"

=item "DES-EDE-CBC"

=item "DES-EDE-OFB"

=item "DES-EDE-CFB"

=item "DES3-WRAP"

=back

The following algorithms are available in the legacy provider:

=over 4

=item "DES-ECB"

=item "DES-CBC"

=item "DES-OFB"

=item "DES-CFB", "DES-CFB1" and "DES-CFB8"

=item "DESX-CBC"

=back

=head2 Parameters

This implementation supports the parameters described in
L<EVP_EncryptInit(3)/PARAMETERS> including "encrypt-check" and "fips-indicator".
