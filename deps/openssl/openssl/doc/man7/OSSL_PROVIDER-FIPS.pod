=head1 NAME

OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS - OpenSSL FIPS provider

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The OpenSSL FIPS provider is a special provider that conforms to the Federal 
Information Processing Standards (FIPS) specified in FIPS 140-2. This 'module'
contains an approved set of cryptographic algorithms that is validated by an
accredited testing laboratory.

=head2 Properties

The implementations in this provider specifically have these properties
defined:

=over 4

=item "provider=fips"

=item "fips=yes"

=back

It may be used in a property query string with fetching functions such as
L<EVP_MD_fetch(3)> or L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)>, as well as with other
functions that take a property query string, such as
L<EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name(3)>.

It isn't mandatory to query for any of these properties, except to
make sure to get implementations of this provider and none other.

The "fips=yes" property can be use to make sure only FIPS approved
implementations are used for crypto operations.  This may also include
other non-crypto support operations that are not in the fips provider,
such as asymmetric key encoders,
see L<OSSL_PROVIDER-default(7)/Asymmetric Key Management>.

=head1 SELF TESTING

One of the requirements for the FIPS module is self testing. An optional callback
mechanism is available to return information to the user using
L<OSSL_SELF_TEST_set_callback(3)>.

The parameters passed to the callback are described in L<OSSL_SELF_TEST_new(3)>

The OpenSSL FIPS module uses the following mechanism to provide information
about the self tests as they run.
This is useful for debugging if a self test is failing.
The callback also allows forcing any self test to fail, in order to check that
it operates correctly on failure.
Note that all self tests run even if a self test failure occurs.

The FIPS module passes the following type(s) to OSSL_SELF_TEST_onbegin().

=over 4

=item "Module_Integrity" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_MODULE_INTEGRITY>)

Uses HMAC SHA256 on the module file to validate that the module has not been
modified. The integrity value is compared to a value written to a configuration
file during installation.

=item "Install_Integrity" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_INSTALL_INTEGRITY>)

Uses HMAC SHA256 on a fixed string to validate that the installation process
has already been performed and the self test KATS have already been tested,
The integrity value is compared to a value written to a configuration
file after successfully running the self tests during installation.

=item "KAT_Cipher" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_KAT_CIPHER>)

Known answer test for a symmetric cipher.

=item "KAT_AsymmetricCipher" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_KAT_ASYM_CIPHER>)

Known answer test for a asymmetric cipher.

=item "KAT_Digest" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_KAT_DIGEST>)

Known answer test for a digest.

=item "KAT_Signature" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_KAT_SIGNATURE>)

Known answer test for a signature.

=item "PCT_Signature" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_PCT_SIGNATURE>)      

Pairwise Consistency check for a signature.

=item "KAT_KDF" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_KAT_KDF>)

Known answer test for a key derivation function.

=item "KAT_KA" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_KAT_KA>)

Known answer test for key agreement.

=item "DRBG" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_DRBG>)

Known answer test for a Deterministic Random Bit Generator.

=item "Conditional_PCT" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_PCT>)

Conditional test that is run during the generation of key pairs.

=item "Continuous_RNG_Test" (B<OSSL_SELF_TEST_TYPE_CRNG>)

Continuous random number generator test.

=back

The "Module_Integrity" self test is always run at startup.
The "Install_Integrity" self test is used to check if the self tests have
already been run at installation time. If they have already run then the
self tests are not run on subsequent startups.
All other self test categories are run once at installation time, except for the
"Pairwise_Consistency_Test".

There is only one instance of the "Module_Integrity" and "Install_Integrity"
self tests. All other self tests may have multiple instances.


The FIPS module passes the following descriptions(s) to OSSL_SELF_TEST_onbegin().

"Module_Integrity" and "Install_Integrity" use this.

  static OSSL_CALLBACK self_test_cb;

  static int self_test_cb(const OSSL_PARAM params[], void *arg)
  {
    int ret = 0;
    const OSSL_PARAM *p = NULL;
    const char *phase = NULL, *type = NULL, *desc = NULL;

    p = OSSL_PARAM_locate_const(params, OSSL_PROV_PARAM_SELF_TEST_PHASE);
    if (p == NULL || p->data_type != OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING)
        goto err;
    phase = (const char *)p->data;

    p = OSSL_PARAM_locate_const(params, OSSL_PROV_PARAM_SELF_TEST_DESC);
    if (p == NULL || p->data_type != OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING)
        goto err;
    desc = (const char *)p->data;

    p = OSSL_PARAM_locate_const(params, OSSL_PROV_PARAM_SELF_TEST_TYPE);
    if (p == NULL || p->data_type != OSSL_PARAM_UTF8_STRING)
        goto err;
    type = (const char *)p->data;

    /* Do some logging */
    if (strcmp(phase, OSSL_SELF_TEST_PHASE_START) == 0)
        BIO_printf(bio_out, "%s : (%s) : ", desc, type);
    if (strcmp(phase, OSSL_SELF_TEST_PHASE_PASS) == 0
            || strcmp(phase, OSSL_SELF_TEST_PHASE_FAIL) == 0)
        BIO_printf(bio_out, "%s\n", phase);
