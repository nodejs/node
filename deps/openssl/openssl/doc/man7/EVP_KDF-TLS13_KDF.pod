=head1 NAME

EVP_KDF-TLS13_KDF - The TLS 1.3 EVP_KDF implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing the TLS 1.3 version of the B<HKDF> KDF through
the B<EVP_KDF> API.

The EVP_KDF-TLS13_KDF algorithm implements the HKDF key derivation function
as used by TLS 1.3.

=head2 Identity

"TLS13-KDF" is the name for this implementation; it
can be used with the EVP_KDF_fetch() function.

=head2 Supported parameters

The supported parameters are:

=over 4

=item "properties" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PROPERTIES>) <UTF8 string>

=item "digest" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_DIGEST>) <UTF8 string>

=item "key" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_KEY>) <octet string>

=item "salt" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_SALT>) <octet string>

These parameters work as described in L<EVP_KDF(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=item "prefix" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_PREFIX>) <octet string>

This parameter sets the label prefix on the specified TLS 1.3 KDF context.
For TLS 1.3 this should be set to the ASCII string "tls13 " without a
trailing zero byte.  Refer to RFC 8446 section 7.1 "Key Schedule" for details.

=item "label" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_LABEL>) <octet string>

This parameter sets the label on the specified TLS 1.3 KDF context.
Refer to RFC 8446 section 7.1 "Key Schedule" for details.

=item "data" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_DATA>) <octet string>

This parameter sets the context data on the specified TLS 1.3 KDF context.
Refer to RFC 8446 section 7.1 "Key Schedule" for details.

=item "mode" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_MODE>) <UTF8 string> or <integer>

This parameter sets the mode for the TLS 1.3 KDF operation.
There are two modes that are currently defined:

=over 4

=item "EXTRACT_ONLY" or B<EVP_KDF_HKDF_MODE_EXTRACT_ONLY>

In this mode calling L<EVP_KDF_derive(3)> will just perform the extract
operation. The value returned will be the intermediate fixed-length pseudorandom
key K.  The I<keylen> parameter must match the size of K, which can be looked
up by calling EVP_KDF_CTX_get_kdf_size() after setting the mode and digest.

The digest, key and salt values must be set before a key is derived otherwise
an error will occur.

=item "EXPAND_ONLY" or B<EVP_KDF_HKDF_MODE_EXPAND_ONLY>

In this mode calling L<EVP_KDF_derive(3)> will just perform the expand
operation. The input key should be set to the intermediate fixed-length
pseudorandom key K returned from a previous extract operation.

The digest, key and info values must be set before a key is derived otherwise
an error will occur.

=head1 NOTES

This KDF is intended for use by the TLS 1.3 implementation in libssl.
It does not support all the options and capabilities that HKDF does.

The I<OSSL_PARAM> array passed to L<EVP_KDF_derive(3)> or
L<EVP_KDF_CTX_set_params(3)> must specify all of the parameters required.
This KDF does not support a piecemeal approach to providing these.

A context for a TLS 1.3 KDF can be obtained by calling:

 EVP_KDF *kdf = EVP_KDF_fetch(NULL, "TLS13-KDF", NULL);
 EVP_KDF_CTX *kctx = EVP_KDF_CTX_new(kdf);

The output length of a TLS 1.3 KDF expand operation is specified via the
I<keylen> parameter to the L<EVP_KDF_derive(3)> function.  When using
EVP_KDF_HKDF_MODE_EXTRACT_ONLY the I<keylen> parameter must equal the size of
the intermediate fixed-length pseudorandom key otherwise an error will occur.
For that mode, the fixed output size can be looked up by calling
EVP_KDF_CTX_get_kdf_size() after setting the mode and digest on the
B<EVP_KDF_CTX>.
