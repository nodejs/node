=head1 NAME

openssl-quic-concurrency - OpenSSL QUIC Concurrency Model

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A QUIC domain is a group of QUIC resources such as listeners (see
L<SSL_new_listener(3)>) and connections which share common event processing
resources, such as internal pollers, timers and locks. All usage of OpenSSL QUIC
happens inside a QUIC domain.

These resources can be accessed and used concurrently depending on the
circumstances. This man page discusses the available concurrency models and how
they can be used.

=head1 EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT QUIC DOMAINS

A QUIC domain is instantiated either explicitly (L<SSL_new_domain(3)>) or
implicitly by calling L<SSL_new(3)> or L<SSL_new_listener(3)>:

=over 4

=item

An explicit QUIC domain is created by and visible to the application as a QUIC
domain SSL object and has other QUIC SSL objects created underneath it, such as
listeners or connections.

=item

An implicit QUIC domain is one which is created internally due to the direct
creation of a QUIC connection or listener SSL object; the application does not
explicitly create a QUIC domain SSL object and never directly references the
domain.

=back

Explicit creation of a QUIC domain provides the greatest level of control for an
application. Applications can use an implicit QUIC domain for ease of use and to
avoid needing to create a separate QUIC domain SSL object.

Regardless of whether a QUIC domain is explicitly created, the internal
processing model is the same and the application must choose an appropriate
concurrency model as discussed below.

=head1 CONCURRENCY MODELS

The OpenSSL QUIC implementation supports multiple concurrency models to support
a wide variety of usage scenarios.

The available concurrency models are as follows:

=over 4

=item *

The B<Single-Threaded Concurrency Model (SCM)>, which supports only
application-synchronised single-threaded usage.

=item *

The B<Contentive Concurrency Model (CCM)>, which supports multi-threaded usage.

=item *

The B<Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model (TACM)>, which also supports
multi-threaded usage and provides assistance to an application for handling QUIC
timer events.

=back

The merits of these models are as follows:

=over 4

=item *

The B<Single-Threaded Concurrency Model (SCM)> performs no locking or
synchronisation. It is entirely up to the application to synchronise access to
the QUIC domain and its subsidiary SSL objects.

This concurrency model is also useful for an application which wants to use the
OpenSSL QUIC implementation as a pure state machine.

=item *

The B<Contentive Concurrency Model (CCM)> performs automatic locking when making
API calls to SSL objects in a QUIC domain. This provides automatic
synchronisation for multi-threaded usage of QUIC objects. For example, different
QUIC stream SSL objects in the same QUIC connection can be safely accessed from
different threads.

This concurrency model adds the overhead of locking over the Single-Threaded
Concurrency Model in order to support multi-threaded usage, but provides limited
performance in highly contended multi-threaded usage due to its simple approach.
However, it may still prove a good solution for a broad class of applications
which spend the majority of their time in application logic and not in QUIC I/O
processing.

An advantage of this model relative to the more sophisticated concurrency models
below is that it does not create any OS threads.

=item *

The B<Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model (TACM)> is identical to the Contentive
Concurrency Model except that a thread is spun up in the background to ensure
that QUIC timer events are handled in a timely fashion. This ensures that QUIC
timeout events are handled even if an application does not periodically call
into the QUIC domain to ensure that any outstanding QUIC-related timer or
network I/O events are handled. The assist thread contends for the same
resources like any other thread. However, handshake layer events (TLS) are never
processed by the assist thread.

=back

The default concurrency model is CCM or TACM, depending on the B<SSL_METHOD>
used with a B<SSL_CTX>. Using L<OSSL_QUIC_client_method(3)> results in a default
concurrency model of CCM, whereas using L<OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method(3)>
results in a default concurrency model of TACM.

Additional concurrency models may be offered in future releases of OpenSSL.

=head1 BLOCKING I/O CAPABILITIES

All of the supported concurrency models are capable of supporting blocking I/O
calls, where application-level I/O calls (for example, to L<SSL_read_ex(3)> or
L<SSL_write_ex(3)> on a QUIC stream SSL object) block until the request can be
serviced. This includes the use of L<SSL_poll(3)> in a blocking fashion.

Supporting blocking API calls reliably with multi-threaded usage requires the
creation of additional OS resources such as internal file descriptors to allow
threads to be woken when necessary. This creation of internal OS resources is
optional and may need to be explicitly requested by an application depending on
the chosen concurrency model. If this functionality is disabled, depending on
the chosen concurrency model, blocking API calls may not be available and calls
to L<SSL_set_blocking_mode(3)> attempting to enable blocking mode may fail,
notwithstanding the following section.

=head2 Legacy Blocking Support Compatibility

OpenSSL 3.2 and 3.3 contained a buggy implementation of blocking QUIC I/O calls
which is only reliable under single-threaded usage. This functionality is always
available in the Single-Threaded Concurrency Model (SCM), where it works
reliably.

For compatibility reasons, this functionality is also available under the
default concurrency model if the application does not explicitly specify a
concurrency model or disable it. This is known as Legacy Blocking Compatibility
Mode, and its usage is not recommended for multi-threaded applications.

=head1 RECOMMENDED USAGE

New applications are advised to choose a concurrency model as follows:

=over 4

=item *

A purely single-threaded application, or an application which wishes to use
OpenSSL QUIC as a state machine and manage synchronisation itself, should
explicitly select the SCM concurrency model.

=item *

An application which wants to engage in multi-threaded usage of different QUIC
connections or streams in the same QUIC domain should a) select the CCM or TACM
concurrency model and b) explicitly opt in or out of blocking I/O support
(depending on whether the application wishes to make blocking I/O calls),
disabling Legacy Blocking Compatibility Mode.

An application should select the CCM concurrency model if the application can
guarantee that a QUIC domain will be serviced regularly (for example, because
the application can guarantee that the timeout returned by
L<SSL_get_event_timeout(3)> will be handled). If an application is unable to do
this, it should select the TACM concurrency model.

=item *

Applications should explicitly configure a concurrency model during
initialisation.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURING A CONCURRENCY MODEL

If using an explicit QUIC domain, a concurrency model is chosen when calling
L<SSL_new_domain(3)> by specifying zero or more of the following flags:

=over 4

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD>

Specifying this flag configures the Single-Threaded Concurrency Model (SCM).

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREAD>

Speciyfing this flag configures the Contentive Concurrency Model (CCM) (unless
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_THREAD_ASSISTED> is also specified).

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_THREAD_ASSISTED>

Specifying this flag configures the Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model (TACM).
It implies B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREAD>.

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING>

Enable reliable support for blocking I/O calls, allocating whatever OS resources
are necessary to realise this. If this flag is specified,
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_LEGACY_BLOCKING> is ignored.

Details on the allocated OS resources can be found under L</CONSUMPTION OF OS
RESOURCES> below.

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_LEGACY_BLOCKING>

Enables legacy blocking compatibility mode. See L</Legacy Blocking Support
Compatibility>.

=back

Mutually exclusive flag combinations result in an error (for example, combining
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD> and B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREADED>).

The concurrency model for a domain cannot be changed after the domain is
created.

=head2 Default Behaviour

If none of B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD>, B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREAD> or
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_THREAD_ASSISTED> are provided to L<SSL_new_domain(3)> or
another constructor function which can accept the above flags, the default
concurrency model set on the B<SSL_CTX> is used. This default can be set and get
using L<SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags(3)> and L<SSL_CTX_get_domain_flags(3)>. Any
additional flags provided (for example, B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCCKING>) are added
to the set of inherited flags.

The default concurrency model set on a newly created B<SSL_CTX> is determined as
follows:

=over 4

=item *

If an B<SSL_METHOD> of L<OSSL_QUIC_client_thread_method(3)> is used, the
Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model (TACM) is used with the
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING> flag. This provides reliable blocking functionality.

=item *

Otherwise, if OpenSSL was built without threading support, the Single-Threaded
Concurrency Model (SCM) is used, with the B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_LEGACY_BLOCKING>
flag.

=item *

Otherwise, if an B<SSL_METHOD> of L<OSSL_QUIC_client_method(3)> is used, the
Contentive Concurrency Model (CCM) is used with the
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_LEGACY_BLOCKING> flag.

=item *

Otherwise, the Contentive Concurrency Model (CCM) is used.

=back

The default concurrency model may vary between releases of OpenSSL. An
application may specify one or more of the domain flags above to ensure
consistent usage of a specific concurrency model between releases.

=head2 Configuration of Concurrency Models with Implicit QUIC Domains

If an explicit QUIC domain is not explicitly created using L<SSL_new_domain(3)>,
an implicit QUIC domain is created when calling L<SSL_new_listener(3)> or
L<SSL_new(3)>. Such a domain will use the default domain flags configured on the
B<SSL_CTX> as described above.

=head1 CONSUMPTION OF OS RESOURCES

If full blocking I/O support is selected using B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING>, at
least one socket, socket-like OS handle or file descriptor must be allocated to
allow one thread to wake other threads which may be blocking in calls to OS
socket polling interfaces such as select(2) or poll(2). This is allocated
automatically internally by OpenSSL.

If the Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model (TACM) is selected, a background thread
is spawned. This also implies B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING> and the above.

The internal consumption by OpenSSL of mutexes, condition variables, spin locks
or other similar thread synchronisation primitives is unspecified under all
concurrency models.

The internal consumption by OpenSSL of threads is unspecified under the
Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model.

The internal consumption by OpenSSL of sockets, socket-like OS handles or file
descriptors, or other resources as needed to support inter-thread notification,
is unspecified under the Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model or when using
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING>.

=head1 BEHAVIOUR OF SSL OBJECTS

A QUIC SSL object has blocking mode enabled by default where B<all> of the
following criteria are met:

=over 4

=item *

B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING> or B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_LEGACY_BLOCKING> is enabled;
and

=item *

The QUIC connection is being used with network read and write BIOs which expose
supported poll descriptors. See L<openssl-quic(7)> for details.

=back

In all other cases, a QUIC SSL object has blocking mode disabled by default. The
blocking mode can be changed explicitly using L<SSL_set_blocking_mode(3)>.
