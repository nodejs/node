 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo(SSL_CTX *ctx, const unsigned char *serverinfo,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These functions load "serverinfo" TLS ServerHello Extensions into the SSL_CTX.
A "serverinfo" extension is returned in response to an empty ClientHello

SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo() loads one or more serverinfo extensions from
a byte array into B<ctx>.  The extensions must be concatenated into a 
sequence of bytes.  Each extension must consist of a 2-byte Extension Type, 
a 2-byte length, and then length bytes of extension_data.

SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() loads one or more serverinfo extensions from
B<file> into B<ctx>.  The extensions must be in PEM format.  Each extension
must consist of a 2-byte Extension Type, a 2-byte length, and then length
bytes of extension_data.  Each PEM extension name must begin with the phrase
"BEGIN SERVERINFO FOR ".
