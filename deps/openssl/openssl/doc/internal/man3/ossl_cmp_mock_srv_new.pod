=head1 DESCRIPTION

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_new() allocates the contexts for the CMP mock server
associated with the library context I<libctx> and property query string
I<propq>, both of which may be NULL to select the defaults.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_free() deallocates the contexts for the CMP mock server.

OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX_set1_certOut() sets the certificate to be returned in
cp/ip/kup.

OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX_set1_chainOut() sets the certificate chain to be added to
the extraCerts in a cp/ip/kup.
It should to useful to validate B<certOut>.

OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX_set1_caPubsOut() sets the caPubs to be returned in an ip.

OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX_set_statusInfo() sets the status info to be returned.

OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX_set_send_error() enables enforcement of error responses.

OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX_set_pollCount() sets the number of polls before cert response.

OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX_set_checkAfterTime() sets the number of seconds
the client should wait for the next poll.


=head1 NOTES

CMP is defined in RFC 4210 (and CRMF in RFC 4211).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ossl_cmp_mock_srv() returns a B<OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX> structure on success,
NULL on error.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_free() does not return a value.

All other functions return 1 on success, 0 on error.

=head1 HISTORY

The OpenSSL CMP support was added in OpenSSL 3.0.
