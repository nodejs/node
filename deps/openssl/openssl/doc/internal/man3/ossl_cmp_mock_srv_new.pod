=head1 DESCRIPTION

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_new() allocates the contexts for the CMP mock server
associated with the library context I<libctx> and property query string
I<propq>, both of which may be NULL to select the defaults.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_free() deallocates the contexts for the CMP mock server.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_refCert() sets the reference certificate (or NULL)
to be expected for rr messages and for any oldCertID included in kur messages.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_certOut() sets the certificate (or NULL)
to be returned in cp/ip/kup messages.
Note that on each certificate request the mock server does not produce
a fresh certificate but just returns the same pre-existing certificate.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_chainOut() sets the certificate chain (or NULL)
to be added to the extraCerts in a cp/ip/kup message.
It should be useful for the validation of the certificate given via
ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_certOut().

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_caPubsOut() sets list of certificates (or NULL) to be
returned in the caPubs field an ip message and in a genp of infoType caCerts.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_newWithNew() sets the value (which may be NULL)
of the newWithNew field to be returned in a genp of infoType rootCaKeyUpdate.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_newWithOld() sets the value (which may be NULL)
of the newWithOld field to be returned in a genp of infoType rootCaKeyUpdate.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set1_oldWithNew() sets the value (which may be NULL)
of the oldWithNew field to be returned in a genp of infoType rootCaKeyUpdate.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set_statusInfo() sets the status info to be returned.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set_sendError() enables enforcement of error responses
for requests of the given I<bodytype>, or for all requests if I<bodytype> is 1.
A I<bodytype> of -1 can be used to disable this feature, which is the default.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set_pollCount() sets the number of polls before cert response.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_set_checkAfterTime() sets the number of seconds
the client should wait for the next poll.

=head1 NOTES

CMP is defined in RFC 4210 (and CRMF in RFC 4211).

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ossl_cmp_mock_srv() returns a B<OSSL_CMP_SRV_CTX> structure on success,
NULL on error.

ossl_cmp_mock_srv_free() does not return a value.

All other functions return 1 on success, 0 on error.

=head1 HISTORY

The OpenSSL CMP support was added in OpenSSL 3.0.
