=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex(const char *file,
                                                 OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx,
                                                 const char *propq);
 STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *SSL_load_client_CA_file(const char *file);

 int SSL_add_file_cert_subjects_to_stack(STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *stack,
                                         const char *file);
 int SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack(STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *stack,
                                        const char *dir);
 int SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack(STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *stack,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex() reads certificates from I<file> and returns
a STACK_OF(X509_NAME) with the subject names found. The library context I<libctx>
and property query I<propq> are used when fetching algorithms from providers.

SSL_load_client_CA_file() is similar to SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex()
but uses NULL for the library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq>.

SSL_add_file_cert_subjects_to_stack() reads certificates from I<file>,
and adds their subject name to the already existing I<stack>.

SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack() reads certificates from every
file in the directory I<dir>, and adds their subject name to the
already existing I<stack>.

SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack() loads certificates from the
I<store> URI, and adds their subject name to the already existing
I<stack>.

=head1 NOTES

SSL_load_client_CA_file() reads a file of PEM formatted certificates and
extracts the X509_NAMES of the certificates found. While the name suggests
the specific usage as support function for
L<SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(3)>,
it is not limited to CA certificates.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur for SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex(), and
SSL_load_client_CA_file():

=over 4

=item NULL

The operation failed, check out the error stack for the reason.

=item Pointer to STACK_OF(X509_NAME)

Pointer to the subject names of the successfully read certificates.

=back

The following return values can occur for SSL_add_file_cert_subjects_to_stack(),
SSL_add_dir_cert_subjects_to_stack(), and SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack():

=over 4

=item 0 (Failure)

The operation failed.

=item 1 (Success)

The operation succeeded.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Load names of CAs from file and use it as a client CA list:

 SSL_CTX *ctx;
 STACK_OF(X509_NAME) *cert_names;

 ...
 cert_names = SSL_load_client_CA_file("/path/to/CAfile.pem");
 if (cert_names != NULL)
     SSL_CTX_set_client_CA_list(ctx, cert_names);
 else
     /* error */
 ...

=head1 HISTORY

SSL_load_client_CA_file_ex() and SSL_add_store_cert_subjects_to_stack()
were added in OpenSSL 3.0.
