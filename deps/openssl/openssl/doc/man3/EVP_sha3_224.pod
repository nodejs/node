- SHA-3 For EVP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_MD *EVP_sha3_224(void);
 const EVP_MD *EVP_sha3_256(void);
 const EVP_MD *EVP_sha3_384(void);
 const EVP_MD *EVP_sha3_512(void);

 const EVP_MD *EVP_shake128(void);
 const EVP_MD *EVP_shake256(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) is a family of cryptographic hash functions
standardized in NIST FIPS 202, first published in 2015. It is based on the
Keccak algorithm.

=item EVP_sha3_224(),
EVP_sha3_256(),
EVP_sha3_384(),
EVP_sha3_512()

The SHA-3 SHA-3-224, SHA-3-256, SHA-3-384, and SHA-3-512 algorithms
respectively. They produce 224, 256, 384 and 512 bits of output from a given
input.

=item EVP_shake128(),
EVP_shake256()

The SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256 Extendable Output Functions (XOF) that can generate
a variable hash length.

Specifically, B<EVP_shake128> provides an overall security of 128 bits, while
B<EVP_shake256> provides that of 256 bits.

=head1 NOTES

Developers should be aware of the negative performance implications of
calling these functions multiple times and should consider using
L<EVP_MD_fetch(3)> with L<EVP_MD-SHA3(7)> or L<EVP_MD-SHAKE(7)> instead.
See L<crypto(7)/Performance> for further information.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return a B<EVP_MD> structure that contains the
implementation of the message digest. See L<EVP_MD_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_MD> structure.

=head1 CONFORMING TO
