=head1 NAME

RAND_cleanup - erase the PRNG state

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand.h>

Deprecated since OpenSSL 1.1.0, can be hidden entirely by defining
B<OPENSSL_API_COMPAT> with a suitable version value, see
L<openssl_user_macros(7)>:

 void RAND_cleanup(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Prior to OpenSSL 1.1.0, RAND_cleanup() released all resources used by
the PRNG.  As of version 1.1.0, it does nothing and should not be called,
since no explicit initialisation or de-initialisation is necessary. See
L<OPENSSL_init_crypto(3)>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RAND_cleanup() returns no value.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<RAND(7)>

=head1 HISTORY

RAND_cleanup() was deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0; do not use it.
See L<OPENSSL_init_crypto(3)>
