=head1 NAME

OPENSSL_riscvcap - the RISC-V processor capabilities vector

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 env OPENSSL_riscvcap=... <application>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

libcrypto supports RISC-V instruction set extensions. These
extensions are denoted by individual extension names in the capabilities
vector. For Linux platform, when libcrypto is initialized, the results
returned by the RISC-V Hardware Probing syscall (hwprobe) are stored
in the vector. Otherwise all capabilities are disabled.

To override the set of instructions available to an application, you can
set the B<OPENSSL_riscvcap> environment variable before you start the
application.

The environment variable is similar to the RISC-V ISA string defined in the
RISC-V Instruction Set Manual. It is case insensitive. Though due to the limit
of the environment variable parser inside libcrypto, an extension must be
prefixed with an underscore to make it recognizable. This also applies to the
Vector extension.

 OPENSSL_riscvcap="rv64gc_v_zba_zbb_zbs..."

Note that extension implication is currently not implemented.
For example, when "rv64gc_b" is provided as the environment variable,
zba/zbb/zbs would not be implied in the capability vector.

Currently only these extensions are recognized:

Check currently detected capabilities

 $ openssl info -cpusettings
 OPENSSL_riscvcap=ZBA_ZBB_ZBC_ZBS_V
