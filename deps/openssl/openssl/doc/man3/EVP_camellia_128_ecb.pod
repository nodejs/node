EVP_camellia_256_ofb()

Camellia for 128, 192 and 256 bit keys in the following modes: CBC, CFB with
128-bit shift, CFB with 1-bit shift, CFB with 8-bit shift, CTR, ECB and OFB.

=head1 NOTES

Developers should be aware of the negative performance implications of
calling these functions multiple times and should consider using
L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)> with L<EVP_CIPHER-CAMELLIA(7)> instead.
See L<crypto(7)/Performance> for further information.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return an B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
