=head1 NAME

NCONF_new_ex, NCONF_new, NCONF_free, NCONF_default, NCONF_load,
NCONF_get0_libctx, NCONF_get_section, NCONF_get_section_names
- functionality to Load and parse configuration files manually

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/conf.h>

 typedef struct {
     char *section;
     char *name;
     char *value;
 } CONF_VALUE;

 CONF *NCONF_new_ex(OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx, CONF_METHOD *meth);
 CONF *NCONF_new(CONF_METHOD *meth);
 void NCONF_free(CONF *conf);
 CONF_METHOD *NCONF_default(void);
 int NCONF_load(CONF *conf, const char *file, long *eline);
 OSSL_LIB_CTX *NCONF_get0_libctx(const CONF *conf);

 STACK_OF(CONF_VALUE) *NCONF_get_section(const CONF *conf, const char *name);
 STACK_OF(OPENSSL_CSTRING) *NCONF_get_section_names(const CONF *conf);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NCONF_new_ex() creates a new CONF object in heap memory and assigns to
it a context I<libctx> that can be used during loading. If the method table
I<meth> is set to NULL then the default value of NCONF_default() is used.

NCONF_new() is similar to NCONF_new_ex() but sets the I<libctx> to NULL.

NCONF_free() frees the data associated with I<conf> and then frees the I<conf>
object. If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

NCONF_load() parses the file named I<filename> and adds the values found to
I<conf>. If an error occurs I<file> and I<eline> list the file and line that
the load failed on if they are not NULL.

NCONF_default() gets the default method table for processing a configuration file.

NCONF_get0_libctx() gets the library context associated with the I<conf>
parameter.

NCONF_get_section_names() gets the names of the sections associated with
the I<conf> as B<STACK_OF(OPENSSL_CSTRING)> strings. The individual strings
are associated with the I<conf> and will be invalid after I<conf> is
freed. The returned stack must be freed with sk_OPENSSL_CSTRING_free().

NCONF_get_section() gets the config values associated with the I<conf> from
the config section I<name> as B<STACK_OF(CONF_VALUE)> structures. The returned
stack is associated with the I<conf> and will be invalid after I<conf>
is freed. It must not be freed by the caller.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

NCONF_load() returns 1 on success or 0 on error.

NCONF_new_ex() and NCONF_new() return a newly created I<CONF> object
or NULL if an error occurs.

in OpenSSL 3.0.
