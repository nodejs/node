=head1 NAME

OSSL_sleep - delay execution for a specified number of milliseconds

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/crypto.h>

 void OSSL_sleep(uint64_t millis);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_sleep() is a convenience function to delay execution of the calling
thread for (at least) I<millis> milliseconds.  The delay is not guaranteed;
it may be affected by system activity, by the time spent processing the call,
limitation on the underlying system call parameter size or by system timer
granularity.

In particular on Windows the maximum amount of time it will sleep is
49 days and on systems where the regular sleep(3) is used as the underlying
system call the maximum sleep time is about 136 years.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_sleep() does not return any value.

=head1 HISTORY

OSSL_sleep() was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
