=head1 NAME

SSL_dup, SSL_new, SSL_up_ref - create an SSL structure for a connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 SSL *SSL_dup(SSL *s);
 SSL *SSL_new(SSL_CTX *ctx);
 int SSL_up_ref(SSL *s);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_new() creates a new B<SSL> structure which is needed to hold the
data for a TLS/SSL connection. The new structure inherits the settings
of the underlying context B<ctx>: connection method,
options, verification settings, timeout settings. An B<SSL> structure is
reference counted. Creating an B<SSL> structure for the first time increments
the reference count. Freeing it (using SSL_free) decrements it. When the
reference count drops to zero, any memory or resources allocated to the B<SSL>
structure are freed.

SSL_up_ref() increments the reference count for an
existing B<SSL> structure.

The function SSL_dup() creates and returns a new B<SSL> structure from the same
B<SSL_CTX> that was used to create I<s>. It additionally duplicates a subset of
the settings in I<s> into the new B<SSL> object.

For SSL_dup() to work, the connection MUST be in its initial state and
MUST NOT have yet started the SSL handshake.  For connections that are not in
their initial state SSL_dup() just increments an internal
reference count and returns the I<same> handle.  It may be possible to
use L<SSL_clear(3)> to recycle an SSL handle that is not in its initial
state for reuse, but this is best avoided.  Instead, save and restore
the session, if desired, and construct a fresh handle for each connection.

The subset of settings in I<s> that are duplicated are:

=over 4

=item any session data if configured (including the session_id_context)

=item any tmp_dh settings set via L<SSL_set_tmp_dh(3)>,
L<SSL_set_tmp_dh_callback(3)>, or L<SSL_set_dh_auto(3)>

=item any configured certificates, private keys or certificate chains

=item any configured signature algorithms, or client signature algorithms

=item any DANE settings

=item any Options set via L<SSL_set_options(3)>

=item any Mode set via L<SSL_set_mode(3)>

=item any minimum or maximum protocol settings set via
L<SSL_set_min_proto_version(3)> or L<SSL_set_max_proto_version(3)> (Note: Only
from OpenSSL 1.1.1h and above)

=item any verify mode, callback or depth set via L<SSL_set_verify(3)> or
L<SSL_set_verify_depth(3)> or any configured X509 verification parameters

=item any msg callback or info callback set via L<SSL_set_msg_callback(3)> or
L<SSL_set_info_callback(3)>

=item any default password callback set via L<SSL_set_default_passwd_cb(3)>

=item any session id generation callback set via L<SSL_set_generate_session_id(3)>

=item any configured Cipher List

=item initial accept (server) or connect (client) state

=item the max cert list value set via L<SSL_set_max_cert_list(3)>

=item the read_ahead value set via L<SSL_set_read_ahead(3)>

=item application specific data set via L<SSL_set_ex_data(3)>

=item any CA list or client CA list set via L<SSL_set0_CA_list(3)>,
SSL_set0_client_CA_list() or similar functions

=item any security level settings or callbacks

=item any configured serverinfo data

=item any configured PSK identity hint

=item any configured custom extensions

=item any client certificate types configured via SSL_set1_client_certificate_types

=back

SSL_dup() is not supported on QUIC SSL objects and returns NULL if called on
such an object.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur:

=over 4

=item NULL

The creation of a new SSL structure failed. Check the error stack to
find out the reason.

=item Pointer to an SSL structure

The return value points to an allocated SSL structure.

SSL_up_ref() returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.
