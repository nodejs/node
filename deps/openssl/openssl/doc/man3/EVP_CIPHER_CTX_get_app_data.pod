=head1 NAME

EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_app_data, EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_app_data - Routines to
inspect and modify application data related to EVP_CIPHER_CTX

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 void *EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_app_data(const EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx);
 void EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_app_data(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx, void *data);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functions EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_app_data() and EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_app_data()
associate an opaque, application-defined pointer with an EVP_CIPHER_CTX object.

This pointer is not interpreted by the library and is reserved entirely for use
by the application. It may be used to store arbitrary context or state that
needs to be accessible wherever the corresponding EVP_CIPHER_CTX is available.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_app_data() function returns a opaque pointer to the
current application data for the EVP_CIPHER_CTX.
