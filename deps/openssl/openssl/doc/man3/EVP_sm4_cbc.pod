=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_cbc(void);
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_ecb(void);
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_cfb(void);
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_cfb128(void);
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_ofb(void);
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_sm4_ctr(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The SM4 blockcipher (GB/T 32907-2016) for EVP.

All modes below use a key length of 128 bits and acts on blocks of 128 bits.

=head1 NOTES

Developers should be aware of the negative performance implications of
calling these functions multiple times and should consider using
L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)> with L<EVP_CIPHER-SM4(7)> instead.
See L<crypto(7)/Performance> for further information.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return a B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
