=head1 NAME

BIO_f_prefix, BIO_set_prefix, BIO_set_indent, BIO_get_indent
- prefix BIO filter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/bio.h>

 const BIO_METHOD *BIO_f_prefix(void);
 long BIO_set_prefix(BIO *b, const char *prefix);
 long BIO_set_indent(BIO *b, long indent);
 long BIO_get_indent(BIO *b);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BIO_f_cipher() returns the prefix BIO method. This is a filter for
text output, where each line gets automatically prefixed and indented
according to user input.

The prefix and the indentation are combined.  For each line of output
going through this filter, the prefix is output first, then the amount
of additional spaces indicated by the indentation, and then the line
itself.

By default, there is no prefix, and indentation is set to 0.

BIO_set_prefix() sets the prefix to be used for future lines of
text, using I<prefix>.  I<prefix> may be NULL, signifying that there
should be no prefix.  If I<prefix> isn't NULL, this function makes a
copy of it.

BIO_set_indent() sets the indentation to be used for future lines of
text, using I<indent>.  Negative values are not allowed.

BIO_get_indent() gets the current indentation.

=head1 NOTES

BIO_set_prefix(), BIO_set_indent() and BIO_get_indent() are
implemented as macros.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

BIO_f_prefix() returns the prefix BIO method.

BIO_set_prefix() returns 1 if the prefix was correctly set, or <=0 on
failure.

BIO_set_indent() returns 1 if the prefix was correctly set, or <=0 on
failure.

BIO_get_indent() returns the current indentation, or a negative value for failure.
