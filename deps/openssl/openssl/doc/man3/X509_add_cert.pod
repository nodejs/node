=head1 NAME

X509_add_cert,
X509_add_certs -
X509 certificate list addition functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 int X509_add_cert(STACK_OF(X509) *sk, X509 *cert, int flags);
 int X509_add_certs(STACK_OF(X509) *sk, STACK_OF(X509) *certs, int flags);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_add_cert() adds a certificate I<cert> to the given list I<sk>.

X509_add_certs() adds a list of certificate I<certs> to the given list I<sk>.
The I<certs> argument may be NULL, which implies no effect.
It does not modify the list I<certs> but
in case the B<X509_ADD_FLAG_UP_REF> flag (described below) is set
the reference counters of those of its members added to I<sk> are increased.

Both these functions have a I<flags> parameter,
which is used to control details of the operation.

The value B<X509_ADD_FLAG_DEFAULT>, which equals 0, means no special semantics.

If B<X509_ADD_FLAG_UP_REF> is set then
the reference counts of those certificates added successfully are increased.

If B<X509_ADD_FLAG_PREPEND> is set then the certifcates are prepended to I<sk>.
By default they are appended to I<sk>.
In both cases the original order of the added certificates is preserved.

If B<X509_ADD_FLAG_NO_DUP> is set then certificates already contained in I<sk>,
which is determined using L<X509_cmp(3)>, are ignored.

If B<X509_ADD_FLAG_NO_SS> is set then certificates that are marked self-signed,
which is determined using L<X509_self_signed(3)>, are ignored.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Both functions return 1 for success and 0 for failure.

=head1 NOTES

If X509_add_certs() is used with the flags B<X509_ADD_FLAG_NO_DUP> or
B<X509_ADD_FLAG_NO_SS> it is advisable to use also B<X509_ADD_FLAG_UP_REF>
because otherwise likely not for all members of the I<certs> list
the ownership is transferred to the list of certificates I<sk>.

Care should also be taken in case the I<certs> argument equals I<sk>.
