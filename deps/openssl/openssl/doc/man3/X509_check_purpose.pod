=head1 NAME

X509_check_purpose - Check the purpose of a certificate

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509v3.h>

 int X509_check_purpose(X509 *x, int id, int ca)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This function checks if certificate I<x> was created with the purpose
represented by I<id>. If I<ca> is nonzero, then certificate I<x> is
checked to determine if it's a possible CA with various levels of certainty
possibly returned.

Below are the potential ID's that can be checked:

 # define X509_PURPOSE_SSL_CLIENT        1
 # define X509_PURPOSE_SSL_SERVER        2
 # define X509_PURPOSE_NS_SSL_SERVER     3
 # define X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_SIGN        4
 # define X509_PURPOSE_SMIME_ENCRYPT     5
 # define X509_PURPOSE_CRL_SIGN          6
 # define X509_PURPOSE_ANY               7
 # define X509_PURPOSE_OCSP_HELPER       8
 # define X509_PURPOSE_TIMESTAMP_SIGN    9

=head1 RETURN VALUES

For non-CA checks

=over 4

=item -1 an error condition has occurred

=item E<32>1 if the certificate was created to perform the purpose represented by I<id>

=item E<32>0 if the certificate was not created to perform the purpose represented by I<id>

=back

For CA checks the below integers could be returned with the following meanings:

=over 4

=item -1 an error condition has occurred

=item E<32>0 not a CA or does not have the purpose represented by I<id>

=item E<32>1 is a CA.

=item E<32>2 Only possible in old versions of openSSL when basicConstraints are absent.
         New versions will not return this value. May be a CA

=item E<32>3 basicConstraints absent but self signed V1.

=item E<32>4 basicConstraints absent but keyUsage present and keyCertSign asserted.

=item E<32>5 legacy Netscape specific CA Flags present

=back
