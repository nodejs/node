OPENSSL_hexchar2int,
OPENSSL_hexstr2buf_ex, OPENSSL_hexstr2buf,
OPENSSL_buf2hexstr_ex, OPENSSL_buf2hexstr
- Hex encoding and decoding functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/crypto.h>

 int OPENSSL_hexchar2int(unsigned char c);
 int OPENSSL_hexstr2buf_ex(unsigned char *buf, size_t buf_n, long *buflen,
                           const char *str, const char sep);
 unsigned char *OPENSSL_hexstr2buf(const char *str, long *len);
 int OPENSSL_buf2hexstr_ex(char *str, size_t str_n, size_t *strlen,
                           const unsigned char *buf, long buflen, const char sep);
 char *OPENSSL_buf2hexstr(const unsigned char *buf, long buflen);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OPENSSL_hexchar2int() converts a hexadecimal character to its numeric
equivalent.

OPENSSL_hexstr2buf_ex() decodes the hex string B<str> and places the
resulting string of bytes in the given I<buf>.
The character I<sep> is the separator between the bytes, setting this to '\0'
means that there is no separator.
I<buf_n> gives the size of the buffer.
If I<buflen> is not NULL, it is filled in with the result length.
To find out how large the result will be, call this function with NULL
for I<buf>.
Colons between two-character hex "bytes" are accepted and ignored.
An odd number of hex digits is an error.

OPENSSL_hexstr2buf() does the same thing as OPENSSL_hexstr2buf_ex(),
but allocates the space for the result, and returns the result. It uses a
default separator of ':'.
The memory is allocated by calling OPENSSL_malloc() and should be
released by calling OPENSSL_free().

OPENSSL_buf2hexstr_ex() encodes the contents of the given I<buf> with
length I<buflen> and places the resulting hexadecimal character string
in the given I<str>.
The character I<sep> is the separator between the bytes, setting this to '\0'
means that there is no separator.
I<str_n> gives the size of the of the string buffer.
If I<strlen> is not NULL, it is filled in with the result length.
To find out how large the result will be, call this function with NULL
for I<str>.

OPENSSL_buf2hexstr() does the same thing as OPENSSL_buf2hexstr_ex(),
but allocates the space for the result, and returns the result. It uses a
default separator of ':'.
The memory is allocated by calling OPENSSL_malloc() and should be
released by calling OPENSSL_free().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OPENSSL_hexchar2int returns the value of a decoded hex character,
or -1 on error.

OPENSSL_buf2hexstr() and OPENSSL_hexstr2buf()
return a pointer to allocated memory, or NULL on error.

OPENSSL_buf2hexstr_ex() and OPENSSL_hexstr2buf_ex() return 1 on
success, or 0 on error.
