=head1 NAME

CMS_EncryptedData_decrypt, CMS_EnvelopedData_decrypt
- Decrypt CMS EncryptedData or EnvelopedData

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cms.h>

 int CMS_EncryptedData_decrypt(CMS_ContentInfo *cms,
                               const unsigned char *key, size_t keylen,
                               BIO *dcont, BIO *out, unsigned int flags);

 BIO *CMS_EnvelopedData_decrypt(CMS_EnvelopedData *env, BIO *detached_data,
                                EVP_PKEY *pkey, X509 *cert,
                                ASN1_OCTET_STRING *secret, unsigned int flags,
                                OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx, const char *propq);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CMS_EncryptedData_decrypt() decrypts a I<cms> EncryptedData object using the
symmetric I<key> of size I<keylen> bytes. I<out> is a BIO to write the content
to and I<flags> is an optional set of flags.
I<dcont> is used in the rare case where the encrypted content is detached. It
will normally be set to NULL.

The following flags can be passed in the I<flags> parameter.

If the B<CMS_TEXT> flag is set MIME headers for type C<text/plain> are deleted
from the content. If the content is not of type C<text/plain> then an error is
returned.

CMS_EnvelopedData_decrypt() decrypts, similarly to CMS_decrypt(3),
a CMS EnvelopedData object I<env> using the symmetric key I<secret> if it
is not NULL, otherwise the private key of the recipient I<pkey>.
If I<pkey> is given, it is recommended to provide also the associated
certificate in I<cert> - see L<CMS_decrypt(3)> and the NOTES on I<cert> there.
The optional parameters I<flags> and I<dcont> are used as described above.
The optional parameters library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq>
are used when retrieving algorithms from providers.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

CMS_EncryptedData_decrypt() returns 0 if an error occurred otherwise returns 1.

CMS_EnvelopedData_decrypt() returns NULL if an error occurred,
otherwise a BIO containing the decypted content.
