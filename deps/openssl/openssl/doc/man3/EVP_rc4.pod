=head1 NAME

EVP_rc4,
EVP_rc4_40,
EVP_rc4_hmac_md5
- EVP RC4 stream cipher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc4(void);
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc4_40(void);
 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_rc4_hmac_md5(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The RC4 stream cipher for EVP.

=over 4

=item EVP_rc4()

RC4 stream cipher. This is a variable key length cipher with a default key
length of 128 bits.

=item EVP_rc4_40()

RC4 stream cipher with 40 bit key length.

WARNING: this function is obsolete. Its usage should be replaced with the
EVP_rc4() and the EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_key_length() functions.

=item EVP_rc4_hmac_md5()

Authenticated encryption with the RC4 stream cipher with MD5 as HMAC.

WARNING: this is not intended for usage outside of TLS and requires calling of
some undocumented ctrl functions. These ciphers do not conform to the EVP AEAD
interface.

=head1 NOTES

Developers should be aware of the negative performance implications of
calling these functions multiple times and should consider using
L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)> with L<EVP_CIPHER-RC4(7)> instead.
See L<crypto(7)/Performance> for further information.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return an B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
