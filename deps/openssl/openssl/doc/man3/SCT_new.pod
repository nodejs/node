=head1 DESCRIPTION

Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) are defined by RFC 6962, Section 3.2.
They constitute a promise by a Certificate Transparency (CT) log to publicly
record a certificate. By cryptographically verifying that a log did indeed issue
an SCT, some confidence can be gained that the certificate is publicly known.

An internal representation of an SCT can be created in one of two ways.
The first option is to create a blank SCT, using SCT_new(), and then populate
it using:

=over 2

=item *

SCT_set_version() to set the SCT version.

Only SCT_VERSION_V1 is currently supported.

=item *

SCT_set_log_entry_type() to set the type of certificate the SCT was issued for:

B<CT_LOG_ENTRY_TYPE_X509> for a normal certificate.
B<CT_LOG_ENTRY_TYPE_PRECERT> for a pre-certificate.

=item *

SCT_set0_log_id() or SCT_set1_log_id() to set the LogID of the CT log that the SCT came from.

The former takes ownership, whereas the latter makes a copy.
See RFC 6962, Section 3.2 for the definition of LogID.

=item *

SCT_set_timestamp() to set the time the SCT was issued (time in milliseconds
since the Unix Epoch).

=item *

SCT_set_signature_nid() to set the NID of the signature.

=item *

SCT_set0_signature() or SCT_set1_signature() to set the raw signature value.

The former takes ownership, whereas the latter makes a copy.

=item *

SCT_set0_extensions() or B<SCT_set1_extensions> to provide SCT extensions.

The former takes ownership, whereas the latter makes a copy.

=back

Alternatively, the SCT can be pre-populated from the following data using
SCT_new_from_base64():

=over 2

=item *

The SCT version (only SCT_VERSION_V1 is currently supported).

=item *

The LogID (see RFC 6962, Section 3.2), base64 encoded.

=item *

The type of certificate the SCT was issued for:
B<CT_LOG_ENTRY_TYPE_X509> for a normal certificate.
B<CT_LOG_ENTRY_TYPE_PRECERT> for a pre-certificate.

=item *

The time that the SCT was issued (time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch).

=item *

The SCT extensions, base64 encoded.

=item *

The SCT signature, base64 encoded.

=back

SCT_set_source() can be used to record where the SCT was found
(TLS extension, X.509 certificate extension or OCSP response). This is not
required for verifying the SCT.

SCT_free() frees the specified SCT.
If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

SCT_LIST_free() frees the specified stack of SCTs.
If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

=head1 NOTES

Some of the setters return int, instead of void. These will all return 1 on
success, 0 on failure. They will not make changes on failure.

All of the setters will reset the validation status of the SCT to
SCT_VALIDATION_STATUS_NOT_SET (see L<SCT_validate(3)>).

SCT_set_source() will call SCT_set_log_entry_type() if the type of
certificate the SCT was issued for can be inferred from where the SCT was found.
For example, an SCT found in an X.509 extension must have been issued for a pre-
certificate.

SCT_set_source() will not refuse unknown values.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SCT_set_version() returns 1 if the specified version is supported, 0 otherwise.

SCT_set_log_entry_type() returns 1 if the specified log entry type is supported, 0 otherwise.

SCT_set0_log_id() and B<SCT_set1_log_id> return 1 if the specified LogID is a
valid SHA-256 hash, 0 otherwise. Additionally, B<SCT_set1_log_id> returns 0 if
malloc fails.

B<SCT_set_signature_nid> returns 1 if the specified NID is supported, 0 otherwise.

B<SCT_set1_extensions> and B<SCT_set1_signature> return 1 if the supplied buffer
is copied successfully, 0 otherwise (i.e. if malloc fails).

B<SCT_set_source> returns 1 on success, 0 otherwise.
