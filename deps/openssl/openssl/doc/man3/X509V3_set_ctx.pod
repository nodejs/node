=head1 NAME

X509V3_set_ctx,
X509V3_set_issuer_pkey - X.509 v3 extension generation utilities

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509v3.h>

 void X509V3_set_ctx(X509V3_CTX *ctx, X509 *issuer, X509 *subject,
                     X509_REQ *req, X509_CRL *crl, int flags);
 int X509V3_set_issuer_pkey(X509V3_CTX *ctx, EVP_PKEY *pkey);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509V3_set_ctx() fills in the basic fields of I<ctx> of type B<X509V3_CTX>,
providing details potentially needed by functions producing X509 v3 extensions,
e.g., to look up values for filling in authority key identifiers.
Any of I<subject>, I<req>, or I<crl> may be provided, pointing to a certificate,
certification request, or certificate revocation list, respectively.
When constructing the subject key identifier of a certificate by computing a
hash value of its public key, the public key is taken from I<subject> or I<req>.
Similarly, when constructing subject alternative names from any email addresses
contained in a subject DN, the subject DN is taken from I<subject> or I<req>.
If I<subject> or I<crl> is provided, I<issuer> should point to its issuer,
for instance to help generating an authority key identifier extension.
Note that if I<subject> is provided, I<issuer> may be the same as I<subject>,
which means that I<subject> is self-issued (or even self-signed).
I<flags> may be 0
or contain B<X509V3_CTX_TEST>, which means that just the syntax of
extension definitions is to be checked without actually producing an extension,
or B<X509V3_CTX_REPLACE>, which means that each X.509v3 extension added as
defined in some configuration section shall replace any already existing
extension with the same OID.

X509V3_set_issuer_pkey() explicitly sets the issuer private key of
the certificate that has been provided in I<ctx>.
This should be done for self-issued certificates (which may be self-signed
or not) to provide fallback data for the authority key identifier extension.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509V3_set_issuer_pkey() returns 1 on success and 0 on error.

=head1 HISTORY

X509V3_set_issuer_pkey() was added in OpenSSL 3.0.

CTX_TEST was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0; use X509V3_CTX_TEST instead.
