=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 int X509_sign(X509 *x, EVP_PKEY *pkey, const EVP_MD *md);
 int X509_sign_ctx(X509 *x, EVP_MD_CTX *ctx);

 int X509_REQ_sign(X509_REQ *x, EVP_PKEY *pkey, const EVP_MD *md);
 int X509_REQ_sign_ctx(X509_REQ *x, EVP_MD_CTX *ctx);

 int X509_CRL_sign(X509_CRL *x, EVP_PKEY *pkey, const EVP_MD *md);
 int X509_CRL_sign_ctx(X509_CRL *x, EVP_MD_CTX *ctx);

 #include <openssl/x509_acert.h>

 int X509_ACERT_sign(X509_ACERT *x, EVP_PKEY *pkey, const EVP_MD *md);
 int X509_ACERT_sign_ctx(X509_ACERT *x, EVP_MD_CTX *ctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_sign() signs certificate I<x> using private key I<pkey> and message
digest I<md> and sets the signature in I<x>. X509_sign_ctx() also signs
certificate I<x> but uses the parameters contained in digest context I<ctx>.
If the certificate information includes X.509 extensions,
these two functions make sure that the certificate bears X.509 version 3.

X509_REQ_sign(), X509_REQ_sign_ctx(),
X509_ACERT_sign(), X509_ACERT_sign_ctx(),
X509_CRL_sign(), and X509_CRL_sign_ctx()
sign certificate requests and CRLs, respectively.

=head1 NOTES

X509_sign_ctx() is used where the default parameters for the corresponding
public key and digest are not suitable. It can be used to sign keys using
RSA-PSS for example.

For efficiency reasons and to work around ASN.1 encoding issues the encoding
of the signed portion of a certificate, certificate request and CRL is cached
internally. If the signed portion of the structure is modified the encoding
is not always updated meaning a stale version is sometimes used. This is not
normally a problem because modifying the signed portion will invalidate the
signature and signing will always update the encoding.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

All functions return the size of the signature
in bytes for success and zero for failure.

=head1 HISTORY

The X509_sign(), X509_REQ_sign() and X509_CRL_sign() functions are
available in all versions of OpenSSL.

The X509_sign_ctx(), X509_REQ_sign_ctx()
and X509_CRL_sign_ctx() functions were added in OpenSSL 1.0.1.

The X509_ACERT_sign() and X509_ACERT_sign_ctx() functions were added
in OpenSSL 3.4.
