=head1 DESCRIPTION

For all of the functions below that set the supported groups there must be at
least one group in the list. A number of these functions identify groups via a
unique integer NID value. However, support for some groups may be added by
external providers. In this case there will be no NID assigned for the group.
When setting such groups applications should use the "list" form of these
functions (i.e. SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list() and SSL_set1_groups_list).

SSL_CTX_set1_groups() sets the supported groups for B<ctx> to B<glistlen>
groups in the array B<glist>. The array consist of all NIDs of groups in
preference order. For a TLS client the groups are used directly in the
supported groups extension. For a TLS server the groups are used to
determine the set of shared groups. Currently supported groups for
B<TLSv1.3> are B<NID_X9_62_prime256v1>, B<NID_secp384r1>, B<NID_secp521r1>,
B<NID_X25519>, B<NID_X448>, B<NID_ffdhe2048>, B<NID_ffdhe3072>,
B<NID_ffdhe4096>, B<NID_ffdhe6144> and B<NID_ffdhe8192>.

SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list() sets the supported groups for B<ctx> to
string B<list>. The string is a colon separated list of group NIDs or
names, for example "P-521:P-384:P-256:X25519:ffdhe2048". Currently supported
groups for B<TLSv1.3> are B<P-256>, B<P-384>, B<P-521>, B<X25519>, B<X448>,
B<ffdhe2048>, B<ffdhe3072>, B<ffdhe4096>, B<ffdhe6144>, B<ffdhe8192>. Support
for other groups may be added by external providers.

SSL_set1_groups() and SSL_set1_groups_list() are similar except they set
supported groups for the SSL structure B<ssl>.

SSL_get1_groups() returns the set of supported groups sent by a client
in the supported groups extension. It returns the total number of
supported groups. The B<groups> parameter can be B<NULL> to simply
return the number of groups for memory allocation purposes. The
B<groups> array is in the form of a set of group NIDs in preference
order. It can return zero if the client did not send a supported groups
extension. If a supported group NID is unknown then the value is set to the
bitwise OR of TLSEXT_nid_unknown (0x1000000) and the id of the group.

SSL_get_shared_group() returns the NID of the shared group B<n> for a
server-side SSL B<ssl>. If B<n> is -1 then the total number of shared groups is
returned, which may be zero. Other than for diagnostic purposes,
most applications will only be interested in the first shared group
so B<n> is normally set to zero. If the value B<n> is out of range,
NID_undef is returned. If the NID for the shared group is unknown then the value
is set to the bitwise OR of TLSEXT_nid_unknown (0x1000000) and the id of the
group.

SSL_get_negotiated_group() returns the NID of the negotiated group used for
the handshake key exchange process.  For TLSv1.3 connections this typically
reflects the state of the current connection, though in the case of PSK-only
resumption, the returned value will be from a previous connection.  For earlier
TLS versions, when a session has been resumed, it always reflects the group
used for key exchange during the initial handshake (otherwise it is from the
current, non-resumption, connection).  This can be called by either client or
server. If the NID for the shared group is unknown then the value is set to the
bitwise OR of TLSEXT_nid_unknown (0x1000000) and the id of the group.

All these functions are implemented as macros.

The curve functions are synonyms for the equivalently named group functions and
are identical in every respect. They exist because, prior to TLS1.3, there was
only the concept of supported curves. In TLS1.3 this was renamed to supported
groups, and extended to include Diffie Hellman groups. The group functions
should be used in preference.

=head1 NOTES

If an application wishes to make use of several of these functions for
configuration purposes either on a command line or in a file it should
consider using the SSL_CONF interface instead of manually parsing options.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set1_groups(), SSL_CTX_set1_groups_list(), SSL_set1_groups() and
SSL_set1_groups_list(), return 1 for success and 0 for failure.

SSL_get1_groups() returns the number of groups, which may be zero.

SSL_get_shared_group() returns the NID of shared group B<n> or NID_undef if there
is no shared group B<n>; or the total number of shared groups if B<n>
is -1.

When called on a client B<ssl>, SSL_get_shared_group() has no meaning and
returns -1.

SSL_get_negotiated_group() returns the NID of the negotiated group used for
key exchange, or NID_undef if there was no negotiated group.

=head1 HISTORY

The curve functions were added in OpenSSL 1.0.2. The equivalent group
functions were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1. The SSL_get_negotiated_group() function
was added in OpenSSL 3.0.0.
