=head1 NAME

EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key, EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key,
EVP_PKEY_set1_tls_encodedpoint, EVP_PKEY_get1_tls_encodedpoint
- functions to set and get public key data within an EVP_PKEY

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 int EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key(EVP_PKEY *pkey,
                                      const unsigned char *pub, size_t publen);

 size_t EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key(EVP_PKEY *pkey, unsigned char **ppub);

The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be
hidden entirely by defining B<OPENSSL_API_COMPAT> with a suitable version value,
see L<openssl_user_macros(7)>:

 int EVP_PKEY_set1_tls_encodedpoint(EVP_PKEY *pkey,
                                    const unsigned char *pt, size_t ptlen);

 size_t EVP_PKEY_get1_tls_encodedpoint(EVP_PKEY *pkey, unsigned char **ppt);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key() can be used to set the public key value
within an existing EVP_PKEY object. For the built-in OpenSSL algorithms this
currently only works for those that support key exchange. Parameters are not
set as part of this operation, so typically an application will create an
EVP_PKEY first, set the parameters on it, and then call this function.
For example setting the parameters might be done using
L<EVP_PKEY_copy_parameters(3)>.

The format for the encoded public key will depend on the algorithm in use. For
DH it should be encoded as a positive integer in big-endian form. For EC is
should be a point conforming to Sec. 2.3.4 of the SECG SEC 1 ("Elliptic
Curve Cryptography") standard. For X25519 and X448 it should be encoded in a
format as defined by RFC7748.

The key to be updated is supplied in B<pkey>. The buffer containing the encoded
key is pointed to be B<pub>. The length of the buffer is supplied in B<publen>.

EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key() does the equivalent operation except that
the encoded public key is returned to the application. The key containing the
public key data is supplied in B<pkey>. A buffer containing the encoded key will
be allocated and stored in B<*ppub>. The length of the encoded public key is
returned by the function. The application is responsible for freeing the
allocated buffer.

The macro EVP_PKEY_set1_tls_encodedpoint() is deprecated and simply calls
EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key() with all the same arguments. New applications
should use EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key() instead.

The macro EVP_PKEY_get1_tls_encodedpoint() is deprecated and simply calls
EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key() with all the same arguments. New applications
should use EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key() instead.


=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key() returns 1 for success and 0 or a negative
value for failure.

EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key() return 1

=head1 EXAMPLES

See L<EVP_PKEY_derive_init(3)> and L<EVP_PKEY_derive(3)> for information about
performing a key exchange operation.

=head2 Set up a peer's EVP_PKEY ready for a key exchange operation

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 int exchange(EVP_PKEY *ourkey, unsigned char *peer_pub, size_t peer_pub_len)
 {
     EVP_PKEY *peerkey = EVP_PKEY_new();

     if (peerkey == NULL || EVP_PKEY_copy_parameters(peerkey, ourkey) <= 0)
         return 0;

     if (EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key(peerkey, peer_pub,
                                          peer_pub_len) <= 0)
         return 0;

     /* Do the key exchange here */

     EVP_PKEY_free(peerkey);

     return 1;
 }

=head2 Get an encoded public key to send to a peer

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 int get_encoded_pub_key(EVP_PKEY *ourkey)
 {
     unsigned char *pubkey;
     size_t pubkey_len;

    pubkey_len = EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key(ourkey, &pubkey);
    if (pubkey_len == 0)
        return 0;

    /*
     * Send the encoded public key stored in the buffer at "pubkey" and of
     * length pubkey_len, to the peer.
     */

    OPENSSL_free(pubkey);
    return 1;
 }

=head1 HISTORY

EVP_PKEY_set1_encoded_public_key() and EVP_PKEY_get1_encoded_public_key() were
added in OpenSSL 3.0.

EVP_PKEY_set1_tls_encodedpoint() and EVP_PKEY_get1_tls_encodedpoint() were
deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.
