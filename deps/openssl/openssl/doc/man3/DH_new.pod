=head1 NAME

DH_new, DH_free - allocate and free DH objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/dh.h>

The following functions have been deprecated since OpenSSL 3.0, and can be
hidden entirely by defining B<OPENSSL_API_COMPAT> with a suitable version value,
see L<openssl_user_macros(7)>:

 DH* DH_new(void);

 void DH_free(DH *dh);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DH_new() allocates and initializes a B<DH> structure.

DH_free() frees the B<DH> structure and its components. The values are
erased before the memory is returned to the system.
If B<dh> is NULL nothing is done.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, DH_new() returns B<NULL> and sets an error
code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>. Otherwise it returns
a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

DH_free() returns no value.

=head1 HISTORY

All of these functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0.

For replacement see EVP_PKEY-DH(7).
