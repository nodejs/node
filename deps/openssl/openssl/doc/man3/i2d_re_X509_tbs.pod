=head1 NAME

d2i_X509_AUX, i2d_X509_AUX,
i2d_re_X509_tbs, i2d_re_X509_CRL_tbs, i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs
- X509 encode and decode functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 X509 *d2i_X509_AUX(X509 **px, const unsigned char **in, long len);
 int i2d_X509_AUX(const X509 *x, unsigned char **out);
 int i2d_re_X509_tbs(X509 *x, unsigned char **out);
 int i2d_re_X509_CRL_tbs(X509_CRL *crl, unsigned char **pp);
 int i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs(X509_REQ *req, unsigned char **pp);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The X509 encode and decode routines encode and parse an
B<X509> structure, which represents an X509 certificate.

d2i_X509_AUX() is similar to L<d2i_X509(3)> but the input is expected to
consist of an X509 certificate followed by auxiliary trust information.
This is used by the PEM routines to read "TRUSTED CERTIFICATE" objects.
This function should not be called on untrusted input.

i2d_X509_AUX() is similar to L<i2d_X509(3)>, but the encoded output
contains both the certificate and any auxiliary trust information.
This is used by the PEM routines to write "TRUSTED CERTIFICATE" objects.
Note that this is a non-standard OpenSSL-specific data format.

i2d_re_X509_tbs() is similar to L<i2d_X509(3)> except it encodes only
the TBSCertificate portion of the certificate.  i2d_re_X509_CRL_tbs()
and i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs() are analogous for CRL and certificate request,
respectively.  The "re" in B<i2d_re_X509_tbs> stands for "re-encode",
and ensures that a fresh encoding is generated in case the object has been
modified after creation (see the BUGS section).

The encoding of the TBSCertificate portion of a certificate is cached
in the B<X509> structure internally to improve encoding performance
and to ensure certificate signatures are verified correctly in some
certificates with broken (non-DER) encodings.

If, after modification, the B<X509> object is re-signed with X509_sign(),
the encoding is automatically renewed. Otherwise, the encoding of the
TBSCertificate portion of the B<X509> can be manually renewed by calling
i2d_re_X509_tbs().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

d2i_X509_AUX() returns a valid B<X509> structure or NULL if an error occurred.

i2d_X509_AUX() returns the length of encoded data or -1 on error.

i2d_re_X509_tbs(), i2d_re_X509_CRL_tbs() and i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs() return the
length of encoded data or <=0 on error.
