=head1 NAME

CTLOG_STORE_new_ex,
CTLOG_STORE_new, CTLOG_STORE_free,
CTLOG_STORE_load_default_file, CTLOG_STORE_load_file -
Create and populate a Certificate Transparency log list

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ct.h>

 CTLOG_STORE *CTLOG_STORE_new_ex(OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx, const char *propq);
 CTLOG_STORE *CTLOG_STORE_new(void);
 void CTLOG_STORE_free(CTLOG_STORE *store);

 int CTLOG_STORE_load_default_file(CTLOG_STORE *store);
 int CTLOG_STORE_load_file(CTLOG_STORE *store, const char *file);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CTLOG_STORE is a container for a list of CTLOGs (Certificate Transparency
logs). The list can be loaded from one or more files and then searched by LogID
(see RFC 6962, Section 3.2, for the definition of a LogID).

CTLOG_STORE_new_ex() creates an empty list of CT logs associated with
the library context I<libctx> and the property query string I<propq>.

CTLOG_STORE_new() does the same thing as CTLOG_STORE_new_ex() but with
the default library context and property query string.

The CTLOG_STORE is then populated by CTLOG_STORE_load_default_file() or
CTLOG_STORE_load_file(). CTLOG_STORE_load_default_file() loads from the default
file, which is named F<ct_log_list.cnf> in OPENSSLDIR (see the output of
L<openssl-version(1)>). This can be overridden using an environment variable
named B<CTLOG_FILE>. CTLOG_STORE_load_file() loads from a caller-specified file
path instead. Both of these functions append any loaded CT logs to the
CTLOG_STORE.

The expected format of the file is:

 enabled_logs=foo,bar

 [foo]
 description = Log 1
 key = <base64-encoded DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo here>

 [bar]
 description = Log 2
 key = <base64-encoded DER SubjectPublicKeyInfo here>

Once a CTLOG_STORE is no longer required, it should be passed to
CTLOG_STORE_free(). This will delete all of the CTLOGs stored within, along
with the CTLOG_STORE itself. If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

=head1 NOTES

If there are any invalid CT logs in a file, they are skipped and the remaining
valid logs will still be added to the CTLOG_STORE. A CT log will be considered
invalid if it is missing a "key" or "description" field.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Both B<CTLOG_STORE_load_default_file> and B<CTLOG_STORE_load_file> return 1 if
all CT logs in the file are successfully parsed and loaded, 0 otherwise.
