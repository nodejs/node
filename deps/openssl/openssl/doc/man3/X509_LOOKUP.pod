=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<X509_LOOKUP> structure holds the information needed to look up
certificates and CRLs according to an associated L<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD(3)>.
Multiple B<X509_LOOKUP> instances can be added to an L<X509_STORE(3)>
to enable lookup in that store.

X509_LOOKUP_new() creates a new B<X509_LOOKUP> using the given lookup
I<method>.
It can also be created by calling L<X509_STORE_add_lookup(3)>, which
will associate a B<X509_STORE> with the lookup mechanism.

X509_LOOKUP_init() initializes the internal state and resources as
needed by the given B<X509_LOOKUP> to do its work.

X509_LOOKUP_shutdown() tears down the internal state and resources of
the given B<X509_LOOKUP>.

X509_LOOKUP_free() destructs the given B<X509_LOOKUP>.
If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

X509_LOOKUP_set_method_data() and X509_LOOKUP_get_method_data()
associates and retrieves a pointer to application data to and from the
given B<X509_LOOKUP>, respectively.

X509_LOOKUP_ctrl_ex() is used to set or get additional data to or from
a B<X509_LOOKUP> structure using any control function in the
associated L<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD(3)>.
The arguments of the control command are passed via I<argc> and I<argl>,
its return value via I<*ret>. The library context I<libctx> and property
query I<propq> are used when fetching algorithms from providers.
The meaning of the arguments depends on the I<cmd> number of the
control command. In general, this function is not called directly, but
wrapped by a macro call, see below.
The control I<cmd>s known to OpenSSL are discussed in more depth
in L</Control Commands>.

X509_LOOKUP_ctrl() is similar to X509_LOOKUP_ctrl_ex() but
uses NULL for the library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq>.

X509_LOOKUP_load_file_ex() passes a filename to be loaded immediately
into the associated B<X509_STORE>. The library context I<libctx> and property
query I<propq> are used when fetching algorithms from providers.
I<type> indicates what type of object is expected.
This can only be used with a lookup using the implementation
L<X509_LOOKUP_file(3)>.

X509_LOOKUP_load_file() is similar to X509_LOOKUP_load_file_ex() but
uses NULL for the library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq>.

X509_LOOKUP_add_dir() passes a directory specification from which
certificates and CRLs are loaded on demand into the associated
B<X509_STORE>.
I<type> indicates what type of object is expected.
This can only be used with a lookup using the implementation
L<X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir(3)>.

X509_LOOKUP_add_store_ex() passes a URI for a directory-like structure
from which containers with certificates and CRLs are loaded on demand
into the associated B<X509_STORE>. The library context I<libctx> and property
query I<propq> are used when fetching algorithms from providers.

X509_LOOKUP_add_store() is similar to X509_LOOKUP_add_store_ex() but
uses NULL for the library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq>.

X509_LOOKUP_load_store_ex() passes a URI for a single container from
which certificates and CRLs are immediately loaded into the associated
B<X509_STORE>. The library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq> are used
when fetching algorithms from providers.
These functions can only be used with a lookup using the
implementation L<X509_LOOKUP_store(3)>.

X509_LOOKUP_load_store() is similar to X509_LOOKUP_load_store_ex() but
uses NULL for the library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq>.

X509_LOOKUP_load_file_ex(), X509_LOOKUP_load_file(),
X509_LOOKUP_add_dir(),
X509_LOOKUP_add_store_ex() X509_LOOKUP_add_store(),
X509_LOOKUP_load_store_ex() and X509_LOOKUP_load_store() are
implemented as macros that use X509_LOOKUP_ctrl().

X509_LOOKUP_by_subject_ex(), X509_LOOKUP_by_subject(),
X509_LOOKUP_by_issuer_serial(), X509_LOOKUP_by_fingerprint(), and
X509_LOOKUP_by_alias() look up certificates and CRLs in the L<X509_STORE(3)>
associated with the B<X509_LOOKUP> using different criteria, where the looked up
object is stored in I<ret>.
Some of the underlying B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD>s will also cache objects
matching the criteria in the associated B<X509_STORE>, which makes it
possible to handle cases where the criteria have more than one hit.

=head2 Control Commands

The B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD>s built into OpenSSL recognize the following
X509_LOOKUP_ctrl() I<cmd>s:

=over 4

=item B<X509_L_FILE_LOAD>

This is the command that X509_LOOKUP_load_file_ex() and
X509_LOOKUP_load_file() use.
The filename is passed in I<argc>, and the type in I<argl>.

=item B<X509_L_ADD_DIR>

This is the command that X509_LOOKUP_add_dir() uses.
The directory specification is passed in I<argc>, and the type in
I<argl>.

=item B<X509_L_ADD_STORE>

This is the command that X509_LOOKUP_add_store_ex() and
X509_LOOKUP_add_store() use.
The URI is passed in I<argc>.

=item B<X509_L_LOAD_STORE>

This is the command that X509_LOOKUP_load_store_ex() and
X509_LOOKUP_load_store() use.
The URI is passed in I<argc>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509_LOOKUP_new() returns a B<X509_LOOKUP> pointer when successful,
or NULL on error.

X509_LOOKUP_init() and X509_LOOKUP_shutdown() return 1 on success, or
0 on error.

X509_LOOKUP_ctrl_ex() and X509_LOOKUP_ctrl()
return -1 if the B<X509_LOOKUP> doesn't have an
associated B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD>, or 1 if the X<509_LOOKUP_METHOD>
doesn't have a control function.
Otherwise, it returns what the control function in the
B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD> returns, which is usually 1 on success and 0 on error
but could also be -1 on failure.

X509_LOOKUP_get_store() returns a B<X509_STORE> pointer if there is
one, otherwise NULL.

X509_LOOKUP_by_subject_ex() returns 0 if there is no B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD>
that implements any of the get_by_subject_ex() or get_by_subject() functions.
It calls get_by_subject_ex() if present, otherwise get_by_subject(), and returns
the result of the function, which is usually 1 on success and 0 on error.

X509_LOOKUP_by_subject() is similar to X509_LOOKUP_by_subject_ex()
but passes NULL for both the libctx and propq.

X509_LOOKUP_by_issuer_serial(), X509_LOOKUP_by_fingerprint(), and
X509_LOOKUP_by_alias() all return 0 if there is no B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD> or that
method doesn't implement the corresponding function.
Otherwise, they return what the corresponding function in the
B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD> returns, which is usually 1 on success and 0 in
error.
