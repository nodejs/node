=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 X509 *X509_new(void);
 X509 *X509_new_ex(OSSL_LIB_CTX *libctx, const char *propq);
 void X509_free(X509 *a);
 int X509_up_ref(X509 *a);
 STACK_OF(X509) *X509_chain_up_ref(STACK_OF(X509) *x);
 void OSSL_STACK_OF_X509_free(STACK_OF(X509) *certs);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The X509 ASN1 allocation routines allocate and free an
X509 structure, which represents an X509 certificate.

X509_new_ex() allocates and initializes a X509 structure with a
library context of I<libctx>, property query of I<propq> and a reference
count of B<1>. Many X509 functions such as X509_check_purpose(), and
X509_verify() use this library context to select which providers supply the
fetched algorithms (SHA1 is used internally). This created X509 object can then
be used when loading binary data using d2i_X509().

X509_new() is similar to X509_new_ex() but sets the library context
and property query to NULL. This results in the default (NULL) library context
being used for any X509 operations requiring algorithm fetches.

X509_free() decrements the reference count of B<X509> structure B<a> and
frees it up if the reference count is zero. If the argument is NULL,
nothing is done.

X509_up_ref() increments the reference count of B<a>.

X509_chain_up_ref() increases the reference count of all certificates in
chain B<x> and returns a copy of the stack, or an empty stack if B<a> is NULL.

OSSL_STACK_OF_X509_free() deallocates the given list of pointers to
certificates after calling X509_free() on all its elements.
If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

=head1 NOTES

The function X509_up_ref() if useful if a certificate structure is being
used by several different operations each of which will free it up after
use: this avoids the need to duplicate the entire certificate structure.

The function X509_chain_up_ref() doesn't just up the reference count of
each certificate. It also returns a copy of the stack, using sk_X509_dup(),
but it serves a similar purpose: the returned chain persists after the
original has been freed.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, X509_new() returns NULL and sets an error
code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

X509_up_ref() returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.

X509_chain_up_ref() returns a copy of the stack or NULL if an error occurred.

OSSL_STACK_OF_X509_free() has no return value.
