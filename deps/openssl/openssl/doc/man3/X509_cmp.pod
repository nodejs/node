 int X509_issuer_and_serial_cmp(const X509 *a, const X509 *b);
 int X509_issuer_name_cmp(const X509 *a, const X509 *b);
 int X509_subject_name_cmp(const X509 *a, const X509 *b);

 int X509_CRL_match(const X509_CRL *a, const X509_CRL *b);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This set of functions are used to compare X509 objects, including X509
certificates, X509 CRL objects and various values in an X509 certificate.

The X509_cmp() function compares two B<X509> objects indicated by parameters
B<a> and B<b>. The comparison is based on the B<memcmp> result of the hash
values of two B<X509> objects and the canonical (DER) encoding values.

The X509_NAME_cmp() function compares two B<X509_NAME> objects indicated by
parameters B<a> and B<b>. The comparison is based on the B<memcmp> result of
the canonical (DER) encoding values of the two objects. L<i2d_X509_NAME(3)>
has a more detailed description of the DER encoding of the B<X509_NAME> structure.

The X509_issuer_and_serial_cmp() function compares the serial number and issuer
values in the given B<X509> objects B<a> and B<b>.

The X509_issuer_name_cmp(), X509_subject_name_cmp() and X509_CRL_cmp() functions
are effectively wrappers of the X509_NAME_cmp() function. These functions compare
issuer names and subject names of the X<509> objects, or issuers of B<X509_CRL>
objects, respectively.

The X509_CRL_match() function compares two B<X509_CRL> objects. Unlike the
X509_CRL_cmp() function, this function compares the whole CRL content instead
of just the issuer name.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Like common memory comparison functions, the B<X509> comparison functions return
an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if object B<a> is found to
be less than, to match, or be greater than object B<b>, respectively.

X509_NAME_cmp(), X509_issuer_and_serial_cmp(), X509_issuer_name_cmp(),
X509_subject_name_cmp() and X509_CRL_cmp() may return B<-2> to indicate an error.

=head1 NOTES

These functions in fact utilize the underlying B<memcmp> of the C library to do
the comparison job. Data to be compared varies from DER encoding data, hash
value or B<ASN1_STRING>. The sign of the comparison can be used to order the
objects but it does not have a special meaning in some cases.

X509_NAME_cmp() and wrappers utilize the value B<-2> to indicate errors in some
circumstances, which could cause confusion for the applications.
