=head1 NAME

CMS_final, CMS_final_digest - finalise a CMS_ContentInfo structure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/cms.h>

 int CMS_final(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *data, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);
 int CMS_final_digest(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, const unsigned char *md,
                      unsigned int mdlen, BIO *dcont, unsigned int flags);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

CMS_final() finalises the structure B<cms>. Its purpose is to perform any
operations necessary on B<cms> (digest computation for example) and set the
appropriate fields. The parameter B<data> contains the content to be
processed. The B<dcont> parameter contains a BIO to write content to after
processing: this is only used with detached data and will usually be set to
NULL.

CMS_final_digest() finalises the structure B<cms> using a pre-computed digest,
rather than computing the digest from the original data.

=head1 NOTES

These functions will normally be called when the B<CMS_PARTIAL> flag is used. It
should only be used when streaming is not performed because the streaming
I/O functions perform finalisation operations internally.

To sign a pre-computed digest, L<CMS_sign(3)> or CMS_sign_ex() is called
with the B<data> parameter set to NULL before the CMS structure is finalised
with the digest provided to CMS_final_digest() in binary form.
When signing a pre-computed digest, the security relies on the digest and its
computation from the original message being trusted.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

CMS_final() and CMS_final_digest() return 1 for success or 0 for failure.

=head1 HISTORY

CMS_final_digest() was added in OpenSSL 3.2.
