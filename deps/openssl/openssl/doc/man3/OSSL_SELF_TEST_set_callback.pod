=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/self_test.h>

 void OSSL_SELF_TEST_set_callback(OSSL_LIB_CTX *ctx, OSSL_CALLBACK *cb, void *cbarg);
 void OSSL_SELF_TEST_get_callback(OSSL_LIB_CTX *ctx, OSSL_CALLBACK **cb, void **cbarg);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Set or gets the optional application callback (and the callback argument) that
is called during self testing.
The application callback L<OSSL_CALLBACK(3)> is associated with a B<OSSL_LIB_CTX>.
The application callback function receives information about a running self test,
and may return a result to the calling self test.
See L<openssl-core.h(7)> for further information on the callback.

These returned parameters will be NULL if OSSL_SELF_TEST_set_callback() has
not been called.
