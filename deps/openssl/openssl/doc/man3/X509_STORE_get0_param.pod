=head1 NAME

X509_STORE_get0_param, X509_STORE_set1_param,
X509_STORE_get1_objects, X509_STORE_get0_objects, X509_STORE_get1_all_certs
- X509_STORE setter and getter functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509_vfy.h>

 X509_VERIFY_PARAM *X509_STORE_get0_param(const X509_STORE *xs);
 int X509_STORE_set1_param(X509_STORE *xs, const X509_VERIFY_PARAM *pm);
 STACK_OF(X509_OBJECT) *X509_STORE_get1_objects(X509_STORE *xs);
 STACK_OF(X509_OBJECT) *X509_STORE_get0_objects(const X509_STORE *xs);
 STACK_OF(X509) *X509_STORE_get1_all_certs(X509_STORE *xs);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_STORE_set1_param() sets the verification parameters to I<pm> for I<xs>.

X509_STORE_get0_param() retrieves an internal pointer to the verification
parameters for I<xs>. The returned pointer must not be freed by the
calling application

X509_STORE_get1_objects() returns a snapshot of all objects in the store's X509
cache. The cache contains B<X509> and B<X509_CRL> objects. The caller is
responsible for freeing the returned list.

X509_STORE_get0_objects() retrieves an internal pointer to the store's
X509 object cache. The cache contains B<X509> and B<X509_CRL> objects. The
returned pointer must not be freed by the calling application. If the store is
shared across multiple threads, it is not safe to use the result of this
function. Use X509_STORE_get1_objects() instead, which avoids this problem.

X509_STORE_get1_all_certs() returns a list of all certificates in the store.
The caller is responsible for freeing the returned list.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

X509_STORE_get0_param() returns a pointer to an
B<X509_VERIFY_PARAM> structure.

X509_STORE_set1_param() returns 1 for success and 0 for failure.

X509_STORE_get1_objects() returns a pointer to a stack of the retrieved
objects on success, else NULL.

X509_STORE_get0_objects() returns a pointer to a stack of B<X509_OBJECT>.

X509_STORE_get1_all_certs() returns a pointer to a stack of the retrieved
certificates on success, else NULL.
