=head1 NAME

RAND_set_DRBG_type,
RAND_set_seed_source_type
- specify the global random number generator types

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand.h>

 int RAND_set_DRBG_type(OSSL_LIB_CTX *ctx, const char *drbg, const char *propq,
                        const char *cipher, const char *digest);
 int RAND_set_seed_source_type(OSSL_LIB_CTX *ctx, const char *seed,
                               const char *propq);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RAND_set_DRBG_type() specifies the random bit generator that will be
used within the library context I<ctx>.  A generator of name I<drbg>
with properties I<propq> will be fetched.  It will be instantiated with
either I<cipher> or I<digest> as its underlying cryptographic algorithm.
This specifies the type that will be used for the primary, public and
private random instances.

RAND_set_seed_source_type() specifies the seed source that will be used
within the library context I<ctx>.  The seed source of name I<seed>
with properties I<propq> will be fetched and used to seed the primary
random bit generator.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These function return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

=head1 NOTES

These functions must be called before the random bit generators are first
created in the library context.  They will return an error if the call
is made too late.

The default DRBG is "CTR-DRBG" using the "AES-256-CTR" cipher.

The default seed source is "SEED-SRC".

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<EVP_RAND(3)>,
L<RAND_get0_primary(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

These functions were added in OpenSSL 3.0.
