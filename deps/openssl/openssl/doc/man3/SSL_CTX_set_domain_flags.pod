 #define SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD

 int SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags(SSL_CTX *ctx, uint64_t flags);
 int SSL_CTX_get_domain_flags(SSL_CTX *ctx, uint64_t *flags);

 int SSL_get_domain_flags(SSL *ssl, uint64_t *flags);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags() and SSL_CTX_get_domain_flags() set and get the QUIC
domain flags on a B<SSL_CTX> using a QUIC B<SSL_METHOD>. These flags determine
the concurrency model which is used for a QUIC domain. A detailed introduction
to these concepts can be found in L<openssl-quic-concurrency(7)>.

Applications may use either one the flags here:

=over 4

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD>

Specifying this flag configures the Single-Threaded Concurrency Model (SCM).

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREAD>

Speciyfing this flag configures the Contentive Concurrency Model (CCM) (unless
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_THREAD_ASSISTED> is also specified).

If OpenSSL was built without thread support, this is identical to
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD>.

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_THREAD_ASSISTED>

Specifying this flag configures the Thread-Assisted Concurrency Model (TACM).
It implies B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREAD> and B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING>.

This concurrency model is not available if OpenSSL was built without thread
support, in which case attempting to configure it will result in an error.

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_BLOCKING>

Enable reliable support for blocking I/O calls, allocating whatever OS resources
are necessary to realise this. If this flag is specified,
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_LEGACY_BLOCKING> is ignored.

=item B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_LEGACY_BLOCKING>

Enables legacy blocking compatibility mode. See
L<openssl-quic-concurrency(7)/Legacy Blocking Support Compatibility>.

=back

Mutually exclusive flag combinations result in an error (for example, combining
B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_SINGLE_THREAD> and B<SSL_DOMAIN_FLAG_MULTI_THREADED>).

Because exactly one concurrency model must be chosen, the domain flags cannot be
set to 0 and attempting to do so will result in an error.

Changing these flags using SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags() has no effect on QUIC
domains which have already been created.

The default set of domain flags set on a newly created B<SSL_CTX> may vary by
OpenSSL version, chosen B<SSL_METHOD>, and operating environment. See
L<openssl-quic-concurrency(7)> for details. An application can retrieve the
default domain flags by calling SSL_CTX_get_domain_flags() immediately after
constructing a B<SSL_CTX>.

SSL_get_domain_flags() retrieves the domain flags which are effective for a QUIC
domain when called on any QUIC SSL object under that domain.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags(), SSL_CTX_get_domain_flags() and
SSL_get_domain_flags() return 1 on success and 0 on failure.

SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags() fails if called with a set of flags which are
inconsistent or which cannot be supported given the current environment.

SSL_CTX_set_domain_flags() and SSL_CTX_get_domain_flags() fail if called on a
B<SSL_CTX> which is not using a QUIC B<SSL_METHOD>.

SSL_get_domain_flags() fails if called on a non-QUIC SSL object.
