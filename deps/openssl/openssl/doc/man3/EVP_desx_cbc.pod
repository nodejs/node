=head1 NAME

EVP_desx_cbc
- EVP DES-X cipher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/evp.h>

 const EVP_CIPHER *EVP_desx_cbc(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The DES-X encryption algorithm for EVP.

All modes below use a key length of 128 bits and acts on blocks of 128-bits.

=over 4

=item EVP_desx_cbc()

The DES-X algorithm in CBC mode.

This algorithm is not provided by the OpenSSL default provider.
To use it is necessary to load either the OpenSSL legacy provider or another
implementation.

=back

Developers should be aware of the negative performance implications of
calling this function multiple times and should consider using
L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)> instead.
See L<crypto(7)/Performance> for further information.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

These functions return an B<EVP_CIPHER> structure that contains the
implementation of the symmetric cipher. See L<EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(3)> for
details of the B<EVP_CIPHER> structure.
