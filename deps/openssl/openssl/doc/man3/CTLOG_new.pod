=head1 DESCRIPTION

CTLOG_new_ex() returns a new CTLOG that represents the Certificate
Transparency (CT) log with the given public key and associates it with the
library context I<libctx> and property query string I<propq>. A name must also
be provided that can be used to help users identify this log. Ownership of the
public key is transferred.

CTLOG_new() does the same thing as CTLOG_new_ex() but with the default
library context and the default property query string.

CTLOG_new_from_base64_ex() also creates a new CTLOG, but takes the
public key in base64-encoded DER form and sets the ct_log pointer to point to
the new CTLOG. The base64 will be decoded and the public key parsed. The CTLOG
will be associated with the given library context I<libctx> and property query
string I<propq>.

CTLOG_new_from_base64() does the same thing as
CTLOG_new_from_base64_ex() except that the default library context and
property query string are used.

Regardless of whether CTLOG_new() or CTLOG_new_from_base64() is used, it is the
caller's responsibility to pass the CTLOG to CTLOG_free() once it is no longer
needed. This will delete it and, if created by CTLOG_new(), the EVP_PKEY that
was passed to it. If the argument to CTLOG_free() is NULL, nothing is done.

CTLOG_get0_name() returns the name of the log, as provided when the CTLOG was
created. Ownership of the string remains with the CTLOG.

CTLOG_get0_log_id() sets *log_id to point to a string containing that log's
LogID (see RFC 6962). It sets *log_id_len to the length of that LogID. For a
v1 CT log, the LogID will be a SHA-256 hash (i.e. 32 bytes long). Ownership of
the string remains with the CTLOG.

CTLOG_get0_public_key() returns the public key of the CT log. Ownership of the
EVP_PKEY remains with the CTLOG.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

CTLOG_new() will return NULL if an error occurs.

CTLOG_new_from_base64() will return 1 on success, 0 otherwise.
