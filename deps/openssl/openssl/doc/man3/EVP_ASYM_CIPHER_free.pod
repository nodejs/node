=head1 DESCRIPTION

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_fetch() fetches the implementation for the given
B<algorithm> from any provider offering it, within the criteria given
by the B<properties> and in the scope of the given library context B<ctx> (see
L<OSSL_LIB_CTX(3)>). The algorithm will be one offering functions for performing
asymmetric cipher related tasks such as asymmetric encryption and decryption.
See L<crypto(7)/ALGORITHM FETCHING> for further information.

The returned value must eventually be freed with EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_free().

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_free() decrements the reference count for the B<EVP_ASYM_CIPHER>
structure. Typically this structure will have been obtained from an earlier call
to EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_fetch(). If the reference count drops to 0 then the
structure is freed. If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_up_ref() increments the reference count for an
B<EVP_ASYM_CIPHER> structure.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_is_a() returns 1 if I<cipher> is an implementation of an
algorithm that's identifiable with I<name>, otherwise 0.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_get0_provider() returns the provider that I<cipher> was
fetched from.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_do_all_provided() traverses all EVP_ASYM_CIPHERs implemented by
all activated providers in the given library context I<libctx>, and for each of
the implementations, calls the given function I<fn> with the implementation
method and the given I<arg> as argument.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_get0_name() returns the algorithm name from the provided
implementation for the given I<cipher>. Note that the I<cipher> may have
multiple synonyms associated with it. In this case the first name from the
algorithm definition is returned. Ownership of the returned string is retained
by the I<cipher> object and should not be freed by the caller.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_names_do_all() traverses all names for I<cipher>, and calls
I<fn> with each name and I<data>.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_get0_description() returns a description of the I<cipher>,
meant for display and human consumption.  The description is at the
discretion of the I<cipher> implementation.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_gettable_ctx_params() and EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_settable_ctx_params()
return a constant L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> array that describes the names and types of key
parameters that can be retrieved or set by a key encryption algorithm using
L<EVP_PKEY_CTX_get_params(3)> and L<EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params(3)>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_fetch() returns a pointer to an B<EVP_ASYM_CIPHER> for success
or B<NULL> for failure.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_up_ref() returns 1 for success or 0 otherwise.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_names_do_all() returns 1 if the callback was called for all
names. A return value of 0 means that the callback was not called for any names.

EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_gettable_ctx_params() and EVP_ASYM_CIPHER_settable_ctx_params()
return a constant L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> array or NULL on error.
