=head1 NAME

SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version, SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method, SSL_set_ssl_method, SSL_get_ssl_method
- choose a new TLS/SSL method

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 int SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version(SSL_CTX *ctx, const SSL_METHOD *method);
 const SSL_METHOD *SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method(const SSL_CTX *ctx);

 int SSL_set_ssl_method(SSL *s, const SSL_METHOD *method);
 const SSL_METHOD *SSL_get_ssl_method(const SSL *ssl);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version() sets a new default TLS/SSL B<method> for SSL objects
newly created from this B<ctx>.  Most of the configuration attached to the
SSL_CTX object is retained, with the exception of the configured TLS ciphers,
which are reset to the default values.  SSL objects already created from this
SSL_CTX with L<SSL_new(3)> are not affected, except when L<SSL_clear(3)> is
being called, as described below.

SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method() returns the SSL_METHOD which was used to construct the
SSL_CTX.

SSL_set_ssl_method() sets a new TLS/SSL B<method> for a particular B<ssl>
object. It may be reset, when SSL_clear() is called.

SSL_get_ssl_method() returns a pointer to the TLS/SSL method
set in B<ssl>.

=head1 NOTES

The available B<method> choices are described in
L<SSL_CTX_new(3)>.

When L<SSL_clear(3)> is called and no session is connected to
an SSL object, the method of the SSL object is reset to the method currently
set in the corresponding SSL_CTX object.

SSL_CTX_set_version() has unusual semantics and no clear use case;
it would usually be preferable to create a new SSL_CTX object than to
try to reuse an existing one in this fashion.  Its usage is considered
deprecated.

SSL_set_ssl_method() cannot be used to change a non-QUIC SSL object to a QUIC
SSL object or vice versa, or change a QUIC SSL object from one QUIC method to
another.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The following return values can occur for SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version()
and SSL_set_ssl_method():

=over 4

=item Z<>0

The new choice failed, check the error stack to find out the reason.

=item Z<>1

The operation succeeded.

=back

SSL_CTX_get_ssl_method() and SSL_get_ssl_method() always return non-NULL
pointers.
