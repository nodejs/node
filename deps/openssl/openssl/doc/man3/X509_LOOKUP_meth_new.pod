=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD> type is a structure used for the implementation of new
X509_LOOKUP types. It provides a set of functions used by OpenSSL for the
implementation of various X509 and X509_CRL lookup capabilities. One instance
of an X509_LOOKUP_METHOD can be associated to many instantiations of an
B<X509_LOOKUP> structure.

X509_LOOKUP_meth_new() creates a new B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD> structure. It should
be given a human-readable string containing a brief description of the lookup
method.

X509_LOOKUP_meth_free() destroys a B<X509_LOOKUP_METHOD> structure.
If the argument is NULL, nothing is done.

X509_LOOKUP_get_new_item() and X509_LOOKUP_set_new_item() get and set the
function that is called when an B<X509_LOOKUP> object is created with
X509_LOOKUP_new(). If an X509_LOOKUP_METHOD requires any per-X509_LOOKUP
specific data, the supplied new_item function should allocate this data and
invoke L<X509_LOOKUP_set_method_data(3)>.

X509_LOOKUP_get_free() and X509_LOOKUP_set_free() get and set the function
that is used to free any method data that was allocated and set from within
new_item function.

X509_LOOKUP_meth_get_init() and X509_LOOKUP_meth_set_init() get and set the
function that is used to initialize the method data that was set with
L<X509_LOOKUP_set_method_data(3)> as part of the new_item routine.

X509_LOOKUP_meth_get_shutdown() and X509_LOOKUP_meth_set_shutdown() get and set
the function that is used to shut down the method data whose state was
previously initialized in the init function.

X509_LOOKUP_meth_get_ctrl() and X509_LOOKUP_meth_set_ctrl() get and set a
function to be used to handle arbitrary control commands issued by
X509_LOOKUP_ctrl(). The control function is given the X509_LOOKUP
B<ctx>, along with the arguments passed by X509_LOOKUP_ctrl. B<cmd> is
an arbitrary integer that defines some operation. B<argc> is a pointer
to an array of characters. B<argl> is an integer. B<ret>, if set,
points to a location where any return data should be written to. How
B<argc> and B<argl> are used depends entirely on the control function.


X509_LOOKUP_set_get_by_subject(), X509_LOOKUP_set_get_by_issuer_serial(),
X509_LOOKUP_set_get_by_fingerprint(), X509_LOOKUP_set_get_by_alias() set
the functions used to retrieve an X509 or X509_CRL object by the object's
subject, issuer, fingerprint, and alias respectively. These functions are given
the X509_LOOKUP context, the type of the X509_OBJECT being requested, parameters
related to the lookup, and an X509_OBJECT that will receive the requested
object.

Implementations must add objects they find to the B<X509_STORE> object
using X509_STORE_add_cert() or X509_STORE_add_crl().  This increments
its reference count.  However, the X509_STORE_CTX_get_by_subject()
function also increases the reference count which leads to one too
many references being held.  Therefore, applications should
additionally call X509_free() or X509_CRL_free() to decrement the
reference count again.

Implementations should also use either X509_OBJECT_set1_X509() or
X509_OBJECT_set1_X509_CRL() to set the result.  Note that this also
increments the result's reference count.

Any method data that was created as a result of the new_item function
set by X509_LOOKUP_meth_set_new_item() can be accessed with
L<X509_LOOKUP_get_method_data(3)>. The B<X509_STORE> object that owns the
X509_LOOKUP may be accessed with L<X509_LOOKUP_get_store(3)>. Successful
lookups should return 1, and unsuccessful lookups should return 0.

X509_LOOKUP_get_get_by_subject(), X509_LOOKUP_get_get_by_issuer_serial(),
X509_LOOKUP_get_get_by_fingerprint(), X509_LOOKUP_get_get_by_alias() retrieve
the function set by the corresponding setter.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The B<X509_LOOKUP_meth_set> functions return 1 on success or 0 on error.

The B<X509_LOOKUP_meth_get> functions return the corresponding function
pointers.
