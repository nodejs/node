crl - CRL utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl> B<crl>
[B<-inform PEM|DER>]
[B<-outform PEM|DER>]
[B<-text>]
[B<-in filename>]
[B<-out filename>]
[B<-noout>]
[B<-hash>]
[B<-issuer>]
[B<-lastupdate>]
[B<-nextupdate>]
[B<-CAfile file>]
[B<-CApath dir>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<crl> command processes CRL files in DER or PEM format.

=head1 COMMAND OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-inform DER|PEM>

This specifies the input format. B<DER> format is DER encoded CRL
structure. B<PEM> (the default) is a base64 encoded version of
the DER form with header and footer lines.

=item B<-outform DER|PEM>

This specifies the output format, the options have the same meaning as the 
B<-inform> option.

=item B<-in filename>

This specifies the input filename to read from or standard input if this
option is not specified.

=item B<-out filename>

specifies the output filename to write to or standard output by
default.

=item B<-text>

print out the CRL in text form.

=item B<-noout>

don't output the encoded version of the CRL.

=item B<-hash>

output a hash of the issuer name. This can be use to lookup CRLs in
a directory by issuer name.

=item B<-hash_old>

outputs the "hash" of the CRL issuer name using the older algorithm
as used by OpenSSL versions before 1.0.0.

=item B<-issuer>

output the issuer name.

=item B<-lastupdate>

output the lastUpdate field.

=item B<-nextupdate>

output the nextUpdate field.

=item B<-CAfile file>

verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate in
B<file>

=item B<-CApath dir>

verify the signature on a CRL by looking up the issuing certificate in
B<dir>. This directory must be a standard certificate directory: that
is a hash of each subject name (using B<x509 -hash>) should be linked
to each certificate.

=back

=head1 NOTES

The PEM CRL format uses the header and footer lines:

 -----BEGIN X509 CRL-----
 -----END X509 CRL-----

=head1 EXAMPLES

Convert a CRL file from PEM to DER:

 openssl crl -in crl.pem -outform DER -out crl.der

Output the text form of a DER encoded certificate:

 openssl crl -in crl.der -text -noout

=head1 BUGS

Ideally it should be possible to create a CRL using appropriate options
and files too.
