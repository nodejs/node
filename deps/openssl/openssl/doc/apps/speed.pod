=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to test the performance of cryptographic algorithms.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-engine id>

specifying an engine (by its unique B<id> string) will cause B<speed>
to attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the default
for all available algorithms.

=item B<[zero or more test algorithms]>

If any options are given, B<speed> tests those algorithms, otherwise all of
the above are tested.
