features.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Display out a usage message.

=item B<-commands>

Display a list of standard commands.

=item B<-digest-commands>

Display a list of message digest commands, which are typically used
as input to the L<dgst(1)> or L<speed(1)> commands.

=item B<-digest-algorithms>

Display a list of message digest algorithms.
If a line is of the form
  foo => bar
then B<foo> is an alias for the official algorithm name, B<bar>.

=item B<-cipher-commands>

Display a list of cipher commands, which are typically used as input
to the L<dgst(1)> or L<speed(1)> commands.

=item B<-cipher-algorithms>

Display a list of cipher algorithms.
If a line is of the form
  foo => bar
then B<foo> is an alias for the official algorithm name, B<bar>.

=item B<-public-key-algorithms>

Display a list of public key algorithms, with each algorithm as
a block of multiple lines, all but the first are indented.

=item B<-disabled>

Display a list of disabled features, those that were compiled out
of the installation.
