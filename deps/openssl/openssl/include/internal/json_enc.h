 * ossl_json_init
 * --------------

 * Initialises a JSON encoder.

 * If the flag OSSL_JSON_FLAG_SEQ is passed, the output is in JSON-SEQ. The
 * caller should use the encoder as though it is encoding members of a JSON
 * array (but without calling ossl_json_array_begin() or ossl_json_array_end()).
 * Each top-level JSON item (e.g. JSON object) encoded will be separated
 * correctly as per the JSON-SEQ format.
 *
 * If the flag OSSL_JSON_FLAG_SEQ is not passed, the output is in JSON format.
 * Generally the caller should encode only a single output item (e.g. a JSON
 * object).
 *
 * By default, JSON output is maximally compact. If OSSL_JSON_FLAG_PRETTY is
 * set, JSON/JSON-SEQ output is spaced for optimal human readability.
 *
 * If OSSL_JSON_FLAG_IJSON is set, integers outside the range `[-2**53 + 1,
 * 2**53 - 1]` are automatically converted to decimal strings before
 * serialization.

/*
 * ossl_json_in_error
 * ------------------
 *
 * To enhance the ergonomics of the JSON API, the JSON object uses an implicit
 * error tracking model. When a JSON API call fails (for example due to caller
 * error, such as trying to close an array which was not opened), the JSON
 * object enters an error state and all further calls are silently ignored.
 *
 * The caller can detect this condition after it is finished making builder
 * calls to the JSON object by calling this function. This function returns 1
 * if an error occurred. At this point the caller's only recourse is to call
 * ossl_json_reset() or ossl_json_cleanup().
 *
 * Note that partial (i.e., invalid) output may still have been sent to the BIO
 * in this case. Since the amount of output which can potentially be produced
 * by a JSON object is unbounded, it is impractical to buffer it all before
 * flushing. It is expected that errors will ordinarily be either caller errors
 * (programming errors) or BIO errors.
 */

/*
 * JSON Builder Calls
 * ==================
 *
 * These functions are used to build JSON output. The functions which have
 * begin and end function pairs must be called in correctly nested sequence.
 * When writing an object, ossl_json_key() must be called exactly once before
 * each call to write a JSON item.
 *
 * The JSON library takes responsibility for enforcing correct usage patterns.
 * If a call is made that does not correspond to the JSON syntax, the JSON
 * object enters the error state and all subsequent calls are ignored.
 *
 * In JSON-SEQ mode, the caller should act as though the library implicitly
 * places all calls between an ossl_json_array_begin() and
 * ossl_json_array_end() pair; for example, the normal usage pattern would be
 * to call ossl_json_object_begin() followed by ossl_json_object_end(), in
 * repeated sequence.
 *
 * The library does not enforce non-generation of duplicate keys. Avoiding this
 * is the caller's responsibility. It is also the caller's responsibility to
 * pass valid UTF-8 strings. All other forms of invalid output will cause an
 * error. Note that due to the immediate nature of the API, partial output may
 * have already been generated in such a case.
