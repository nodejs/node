/*
 * QUIC Channel Structure
 * ======================
 *
 * QUIC channel internals. It is intended that only the QUIC_CHANNEL
 * implementation and the RX depacketiser be allowed to access this structure
 * directly. As the RX depacketiser has no state of its own and computes over a
 * QUIC_CHANNEL structure, it can be viewed as an extension of the QUIC_CHANNEL
 * implementation. While the RX depacketiser could be provided with adequate
 * accessors to do what it needs, this would weaken the abstraction provided by
 * the QUIC_CHANNEL to other components; moreover the coupling of the RX
 * depacketiser to QUIC_CHANNEL internals is too deep and bespoke to make this
 * desirable.
 *
 * Other components should not include this header.
