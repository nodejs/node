 * RIO_POLL_BUILDER
 * ================
 *
 * RIO_POLL_BUILDER provides support for immediate-mode polling architectures.
 * It abstracts OS-specific immediate-mode polling APIs such as select(2) and
 * poll(2) and allows an arbitrarily large number of FDs to be polled for while
 * providing minimal overhead (over the OS APIs themselves) for small numbers of
 * FDs.
