NOTES FOR THE HPE NONSTOP PLATFORM
==============================

Requirement details
-------------------

In addition to the requirements and instructions listed
in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), the following are required as well:

 * The TNS/X platform supports hardware randomization.
   Specify the `--with-rand-seed=rdcpu` option to the `./Configure` script.
   This is recommended but not required. `egd` is supported at 3.0 but cannot
   be used if FIPS is selected.
 * The TNS/E platform does not support hardware randomization, so
   specify the `--with-rand-seed=egd` option to the `./Configure` script.

About c99 compiler
------------------

The c99 compiler is required for building OpenSSL from source. While c11
may work, it has not been broadly tested. c99 is the only compiler
prerequisite needed to build OpenSSL 3.0 on this platform. You should also
have the FLOSS package installed on your system. The ITUGLIB FLOSS package
is the only FLOSS variant that has been broadly tested.

Threading Models
----------------

OpenSSL can be built using unthreaded, POSIX User Threads (PUT), or Standard
POSIX Threads (SPT). Select the following build configuration for each on
the TNS/X (L-Series) platform:

 * `nonstop-nsx` or default will select an unthreaded build.
 * `nonstop-nsx_put` selects the PUT build.
 * `nonstop-nsx_64_put` selects the 64 bit file length PUT build.
 * `nonstop-nsx_spt_floss` selects the SPT build with FLOSS. FLOSS is
   required for SPT builds because of a known hang when using SPT on its own.

### TNS/E Considerations

The TNS/E platform is build using the same set of builds specifying `nse`
instead of `nsx` in the set above.

You cannot build for TNS/E for FIPS, so you must specify the `no-fips`
option to `./Configure`.

Linking and Loading Considerations
----------------------------------

Because of how the NonStop Common Runtime Environment (CRE) works, there are
restrictions on how programs can link and load with OpenSSL libraries.
On current NonStop platforms, programs cannot both statically link OpenSSL
libraries and dynamically load OpenSSL shared libraries concurrently. If this
is done, there is a high probability of encountering a SIGSEGV condition
relating to `atexit()` processing when a shared library is unloaded and when
the program terminates. This limitation applies to all OpenSSL shared library
components.

It is possible to configure the build with `no-atexit` to avoid the SIGSEGV.
Preferably, you can explicitly call `OPENSSL_cleanup()` from your application.
It is not mandatory as it just deallocates various global data structures
OpenSSL allocated.

About Prefix and OpenSSLDir
---------------------------

Because there are many potential builds that must co-exist on any given
NonStop node, managing the location of your build distribution is crucial.
Keep each destination separate and distinct. Mixing any mode described in
this document can cause application instability. The recommended approach
is to specify the OpenSSL version and threading model in your configuration
options, and keeping your memory and float options consistent, for example:

 * For 1.1 `--prefix=/usr/local-ssl1.1 --openssldir=/usr/local-ssl1.1/ssl`
 * For 1.1 PUT `--prefix=/usr/local-ssl1.1_put --openssldir=/usr/local-ssl1.1_put/ssl`

As of 3.0, the NonStop configurations use the multilib attribute to distinguish
between different models:

 * For 3.0 `--prefix=/usr/local-ssl3.0 --openssldir=/usr/local-ssl3.0/ssl`

The PUT model is placed in `${prefix}/lib-put` for 32-bit models and
`${prefix}/lib64-put` for 64-bit models.

Use the `_RLD_LIB_PATH` environment variable in OSS to select the appropriate
directory containing `libcrypto.so` and `libssl.so`. In GUARDIAN, use the
`=_RLD_LIB_PATH` search define to locate the GUARDIAN subvolume where OpenSSL
is installed.

Float Considerations
--------------------

OpenSSL is built using IEEE Float mode by default. If you need a different
IEEE mode, create a new configuration specifying `tfloat-x86-64` (for Tandem
Float) or `nfloat-x86-64` (for Neutral Float).

Memory Models
-------------

The current OpenSSL default memory model uses the default platform address
model. If you need a different address model, you must specify the appropriate
c99 options for compile (`CFLAGS`) and linkers (`LDFLAGS`).

Cross Compiling on Windows
--------------------------

To configure and compile OpenSSL, you will need to set up a Cygwin environment.
The Cygwin tools should include bash, make, and any other normal tools required
for building programs.

Your `PATH` must include the bin directory for the c99 cross-compiler, as in:

    export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/HPE\ NonStop/L16.05/usr/bin:$PATH

This should be set before Configure is run. For the c99 cross-compiler to work
correctly, you also need the `COMP_ROOT` set, as in:

    export COMP_ROOT="C:\Program Files (x86)\HPE NonStop\L16.05"

`COMP_ROOT` needs to be in Windows form.

An example of a `Configure` command to be run from the OpenSSL directory is:

    ./Configure nonstop-nsx_64 --with-rand-seed=rdcpu

Do not forget to include any OpenSSL cross-compiling prefix and certificate
options when creating your libraries.

The OpenSSL test suite will not run on your workstation. In order to verify the
build, you will need to perform the build and test steps in OSS in your NonStop
server. You can also build under gcc and run the test suite for Windows but that
is not equivalent.

**Note:** In the event that you are attempting a FIPS-compliant cross-compile,
be aware that signatures may not match between builds done under OSS and under
cross-compiles as the compilers do not necessarily generate identical objects.
Anything and everything to do with FIPS is outside the scope of this document.
Refer to the FIPS security policy for more information.

The following build configurations have been successfully attempted at one
point or another. If you are successful in your cross-compile efforts, please
update this list:

- nonstop-nsx_64
- nonstop-nsx_64_put

**Note:** Cross-compile builds for TNS/E have not been attempted, but should
follow the same considerations as for TNS/X above. SPT builds generally require
FLOSS, which is not available for workstation builds. As a result, SPT builds
of OpenSSL cannot be cross-compiled.

Also see the NSDEE discussion below for more historical information.

Cross Compiling with NSDEE
--------------------------

**Note:** None of these builds have been tested by the platform maintainer and
are supplied for historical value. Please submit a Pull Request to OpenSSL
should these need to be adjusted.

If you are attempting to build OpenSSL with NSDEE, you will need to specify
the following variables. The following set of compiler defines are required:

    # COMP_ROOT must be a full path for the build system (e.g. windows)
    COMP_ROOT=$(cygpath -w /path/to/comp_root)
    # CC must be executable by your shell
    CC=/path/to/c99

### Optional Build Variables

    DBGFLAG="--debug"
    CIPHENABLES="enable-ssl3 enable-ssl3-method enable-weak-ssl-ciphers enable-rc4"

### Internal Known TNS/X to TNS/E Cross Compile Variables

The following definition is required if you are building on TNS/X for TNS/E
and have access to a TNS/E machine on your EXPAND network - with an example
node named `\CS3`:

    SYSTEMLIBS="-L/E/cs3/usr/local/lib"

Version Procedure (VPROC) Considerations
----------------------------------------

If you require a VPROC entry for platform version identification, use the
following variables:

### For Itanium

    OPENSSL_VPROC_PREFIX=T0085H06

### For x86

    OPENSSL_VPROC_PREFIX=T0085L01

### Common Definition

    export OPENSSL_VPROC=${OPENSSL_VPROC_PREFIX}_$(
        . VERSION.dat
        if [ -n "$PRE_RELEASE_TAG" ]; then
            PRE_RELEASE_TAG="-$PRE_RELEASE_TAG"
        fi
        if [ -n "$BUILD_METADATA" ]; then
            BUILD_METADATA="+$BUILD_METADATA"
        fi
        echo "$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH$PRE_RELEASE_TAG$BUILD_METADATA" |\
            sed -e 's/[-.+]/_/g'
        )

Example Configure Targets
-------------------------

For OSS targets, the main DLL names will be `libssl.so` and `libcrypto.so`.
For GUARDIAN targets, DLL names will be `ssl` and `crypto`. The following
assumes that your PWD is set according to your installation standards.
