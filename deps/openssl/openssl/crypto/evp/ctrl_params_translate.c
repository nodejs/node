 * The fixup_args functions are called with the following parameters:
 *
 * |state|              The state we're called in, explained further at the
 *                      end of this comment.
 * |translation|        The translation item, to be pilfered for data as
 *                      necessary.
 * |ctx|                The translation context, which contains copies of
 *                      the following arguments, applicable according to
 *                      the caller.  All of the attributes in this context
 *                      may be freely modified by the fixup_args function.
 *                      For cleanup, call cleanup_translation_ctx().
 *
 * The |state| tells the fixup_args function something about the caller and
 * what they may expect:
 *
 * PKEY                         The fixup_args function has been called
 *                              from an EVP_PKEY payload getter / setter,
 *                              and is fully responsible for getting or
 *                              setting the requested data.  With this
 *                              state, the fixup_args function is expected
 *                              to use or modify |*params|, depending on
 *                              |action_type|.
 *
 * PRE_CTRL_TO_PARAMS           The fixup_args function has been called
 * POST_CTRL_TO_PARAMS          from EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl(), to help with
 *                              translating the ctrl data to an OSSL_PARAM
 *                              element or back.  The calling sequence is
 *                              as follows:
 *
 *                              1. fixup_args(PRE_CTRL_TO_PARAMS, ...)
 *                              2. EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params() or

 *
 *                              With the PRE_CTRL_TO_PARAMS state, the

 *                              necessary, when |action_type == SET|.
 *                              With the POST_CTRL_TO_PARAMS state, the
 *                              fixup_args function is expected to modify
 *                              the passed |p2| in whatever way necessary,
 *                              when |action_type == GET|.
 *
 *                              The return value from the fixup_args call
 *                              with the POST_CTRL_TO_PARAMS state becomes
 *                              the return value back to EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl().
 *
 * CLEANUP_CTRL_TO_PARAMS       The cleanup_args functions has been called
 *                              from EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl(), to clean up what
 *                              the fixup_args function has done, if needed.
 *
 *
 * PRE_CTRL_STR_TO_PARAMS       The fixup_args function has been called
 * POST_CTRL_STR_TO_PARAMS      from EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str(), to help with

 *                              OSSL_PARAM element or back.  The calling
 *                              sequence is as follows:
 *
 *                              1. fixup_args(PRE_CTRL_STR_TO_PARAMS, ...)
 *                              2. EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params() or

 *                              3. fixup_args(POST_CTRL_STR_TO_PARAMS, ...)
 *
 *                              With the PRE_CTRL_STR_TO_PARAMS state,
 *                              the fixup_args function is expected to
 *                              modify the passed |*params| in whatever
 *                              way necessary, when |action_type == SET|.
 *                              With the POST_CTRL_STR_TO_PARAMS state,
 *                              the fixup_args function is only expected
 *                              to return a value.
 *
 * CLEANUP_CTRL_STR_TO_PARAMS   The cleanup_args functions has been called
 *                              from EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl_str(), to clean up

 *                              needed.
 *
 * PRE_PARAMS_TO_CTRL           The fixup_args function has been called
 * POST_PARAMS_TO_CTRL          from EVP_PKEY_CTX_get_params() or
 *                              EVP_PKEY_CTX_set_params(), to help with
 *                              translating the OSSL_PARAM data to the

 *                              or the other way around.  The calling
 *                              sequence is as follows:
 *
 *                              1. fixup_args(PRE_PARAMS_TO_CTRL, ...)
 *                              2. EVP_PKEY_CTX_ctrl()
 *                              3. fixup_args(POST_PARAMS_TO_CTRL, ...)
 *
 *                              With the PRE_PARAMS_TO_CTRL state, the
 *                              fixup_args function is expected to modify
 *                              the passed |p1| and |p2| in whatever way
 *                              necessary, when |action_type == SET|.
 *                              With the POST_PARAMS_TO_CTRL state, the
 *                              fixup_args function is expected to
 *                              modify the passed |*params| in whatever
 *                              way necessary, when |action_type == GET|.
 *
 * CLEANUP_PARAMS_TO_CTRL       The cleanup_args functions has been called
 *                              from EVP_PKEY_CTX_get_params() or
