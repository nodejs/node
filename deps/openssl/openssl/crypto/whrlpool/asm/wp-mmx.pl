# whirlpool_block_mmx implementation.
#
*SCALE=\(2); # 2 or 8, that is the question:-) Value of 8 results
# in 16KB large table, which is tough on L1 cache, but eliminates
# unaligned references to it. Value of 2 results in 4KB table, but
# 7/8 of references to it are unaligned. AMD cores seem to be
# allergic to the latter, while Intel ones - to former [see the
# table]. I stick to value of 2 for two reasons: 1. smaller table
# minimizes cache trashing and thus mitigates the hazard of side-
# channel leakage similar to AES cache-timing one; 2. performance
# gap among different Âµ-archs is smaller.
#
# Performance table lists rounded amounts of CPU cycles spent by
# whirlpool_block_mmx routine on single 64 byte input block, i.e.
# smaller is better and asymptotic throughput can be estimated by
# multiplying 64 by CPU clock frequency and dividing by relevant
# value from the given table:
#
#		$SCALE=2/8	icc8	gcc3
# Intel P4	3200/4600	4600(*)	6400
# Intel PIII	2900/3000	4900	5400
# AMD K[78]	2500/1800	9900	8200(**)
#
# (*)	I've sketched even non-MMX assembler, but for the record
#	I've failed to beat the Intel compiler on P4, without using
#	MMX that is...
# (**)	... on AMD on the other hand non-MMX assembler was observed
#	to perform significantly better, but I figured this MMX
#	implementation is even faster anyway, so why bother? As for
#	pre-MMX AMD core[s], the improvement coefficient is more
#	than likely to vary anyway and I don't know how. But the
#	least I know is that gcc-generated code compiled with
#	-DL_ENDIAN and -DOPENSSL_SMALL_FOOTPRINT [see C module for
#	details] and optimized for Pentium was observed to perform
#	*better* on Pentium 100 than unrolled non-MMX assembler
#	loop... So we just say that I don't know if maintaining
#	non-MMX implementation would actually pay off, but till
#	opposite is proved "unlikely" is assumed.
