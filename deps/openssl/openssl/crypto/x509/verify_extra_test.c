 * Test for CVE-2015-1793 (Alternate Chains Certificate Forgery)
 *
 * Chain is as follows:
 *
 * rootCA (self-signed)
 *   |
 * interCA
 *   |
 * subinterCA       subinterCA (self-signed)
 *   |                   |
 * leaf ------------------
 *   |
 * bad
 *
 * rootCA, interCA, subinterCA, subinterCA (ss) all have CA=TRUE
 * leaf and bad have CA=FALSE
 *
 * subinterCA and subinterCA (ss) have the same subject name and keys
 *
 * interCA (but not rootCA) and subinterCA (ss) are in the trusted store
 * (roots.pem)
 * leaf and subinterCA are in the untrusted list (untrusted.pem)
 * bad is the certificate being verified (bad.pem)
 *
 * Versions vulnerable to CVE-2015-1793 will fail to detect that leaf has
 * CA=FALSE, and will therefore incorrectly verify bad
