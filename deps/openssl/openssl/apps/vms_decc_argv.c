     * 2011-03-22 SMS.
     * If we have 32-bit pointers everywhere, then we're safe, and
     * we bypass this mess, as on non-VMS systems.
     * Problem 1: Compaq/HP C before V7.3 always used 32-bit
     * pointers for argv[].
     * Fix 1: For a 32-bit argv[], when we're using 64-bit pointers
     * everywhere else, we always allocate and use a 64-bit
     * duplicate of argv[].
     * Problem 2: Compaq/HP C V7.3 (Alpha, IA64) before ECO1 failed
     * to NULL-terminate a 64-bit argv[].  (As this was written, the
     * compiler ECO was available only on IA64.)
     * Fix 2: Unless advised not to (VMS_TRUST_ARGV), we test a
     * 64-bit argv[argc] for NULL, and, if necessary, use a
     * (properly) NULL-terminated (64-bit) duplicate of argv[].
     * The same code is used in either case to duplicate argv[].
     * Some of these decisions could be handled in preprocessing,
     * but the code tends to get even uglier, and the penalty for
     * deciding at compile- or run-time is tiny.
