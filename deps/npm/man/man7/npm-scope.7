.SH "NAME"
\fBnpm-scope\fR \- Scoped packages
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
All npm packages have a name\. Some package names also have a scope\. A scope
follows the usual rules for package names (url\-safe characters, no leading dots
or underscores)\. When used in package names, preceded by an @\-symbol and
followed by a slash, e\.g\.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
@somescope/somepackagename
.fi
.RE
.P
Scopes are a way of grouping related packages together, and also affect a few
things about the way npm treats the package\.
.P
Scoped packages are supported by the public npm registry\.  The npm
client is backwards\-compatible with un\-scoped registries, so it can be
used to work with scoped and un\-scoped registries at the same time\.
.SH Installing scoped packages
.P
Scoped packages are installed to a sub\-folder of the regular installation
folder, e\.g\. if your other packages are installed in \fBnode_modules/packagename\fP,
scoped modules will be in \fBnode_modules/@myorg/packagename\fP\|\. The scope folder
(\fB@myorg\fP) is simply the name of the scope preceded by an @\-symbol, and can
contain any number of scoped packages\.
.P
A scoped package is installed by referencing it by name, preceded by an
@\-symbol, in \fBnpm install\fP:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm install @myorg/mypackage
.fi
.RE
.P
Or in \fBpackage\.json\fP:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
"dependencies": {
  "@myorg/mypackage": "^1\.3\.0"
}
.fi
.RE
.P
Note that if the @\-symbol is omitted in either case npm will instead attempt to
install from GitHub; see npm help \fBnpm\-install\fP\|\.
.SH Requiring scoped packages
.P
Because scoped packages are installed into a scope folder, you have to
include the name of the scope when requiring them in your code, e\.g\.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
require('@myorg/mypackage')
.fi
.RE
.P
There is nothing special about the way Node treats scope folders, this is
just specifying to require the module \fBmypackage\fP in the folder called \fB@myorg\fP\|\.
.SH Publishing scoped packages
.P
Scoped packages can be published to any registry that supports them, including
the public npm registry\.
.P
(As of 2015\-04\-19, the public npm registry \fBdoes\fR support scoped packages)
.P
If you wish, you may associate a scope with a registry; see below\.
.SS Publishing public scoped packages to the public npm registry
.P
To publish a public scoped package, you must specify \fB\-\-access public\fP with
the initial publication\.  This will publish the package and set access
to \fBpublic\fP as if you had run \fBnpm access public\fP after publishing\.
.SS Publishing private scoped packages to the npm registry
.P
To publish a private scoped package to the npm registry, you must have
an npm Private Modules \fIhttps://www\.npmjs\.com/private\-modules\fR
account\.
.P
You can then publish the module with \fBnpm publish\fP or \fBnpm publish
\-\-access restricted\fP, and it will be present in the npm registry, with
restricted access\.  You can then change the access permissions, if
desired, with \fBnpm access\fP or on the npmjs\.com website\.
.SH Associating a scope with a registry
.P
Scopes can be associated with a separate registry\. This allows you to
seamlessly use a mix of packages from the public npm registry and one or more
private registries, such as npm Enterprise\.
.P
You can associate a scope with a registry at login, e\.g\.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm login \-\-registry=http://reg\.example\.com \-\-scope=@myco
.fi
.RE
.P
Scopes have a many\-to\-one relationship with registries: one registry can
host multiple scopes, but a scope only ever points to one registry\.
.P
You can also associate a scope with a registry using \fBnpm config\fP:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm config set @myco:registry http://reg\.example\.com
.fi
.RE
.P
Once a scope is associated with a registry, any \fBnpm install\fP for a package
with that scope will request packages from that registry instead\. Any
\fBnpm publish\fP for a package name that contains the scope will be published to
that registry instead\.
