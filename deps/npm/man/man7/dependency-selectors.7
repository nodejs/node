The \fB:semver()\fR pseudo selector allows comparing fields from each node's \fBpackage.json\fR using \fBsemver\fR \fI\(lahttps://github.com/npm/node-semver#readme\(ra\fR methods. It accepts up to 3 parameters, all but the first of which are optional.

\fBfunction\fR a semver method to apply, one of: \fBsatisfies\fR, \fBintersects\fR, \fBsubset\fR, \fBgt\fR, \fBgte\fR, \fBgtr\fR, \fBlt\fR, \fBlte\fR, \fBltr\fR, \fBeq\fR, \fBneq\fR or the special function \fBinfer\fR (default \fBinfer\fR)
.RE 0

.P
When the special \fBinfer\fR function is used the \fBspec\fR and the actual value from the node are compared. If both are versions, according to \fBsemver.valid()\fR, \fBeq\fR is used. If both values are ranges, according to \fB!semver.valid()\fR, \fBintersects\fR is used. If the values are mixed types \fBsatisfies\fR is used.

The \fB:outdated\fR pseudo selector retrieves data from the registry and returns information about which of your dependencies are outdated. The type parameter may be one of the following:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
\fBany\fR (default) a version exists that is greater than the current one
.IP \(bu 4
\fBin-range\fR a version exists that is greater than the current one, and satisfies at least one if its dependents
.IP \(bu 4
\fBout-of-range\fR a version exists that is greater than the current one, does not satisfy at least one of its dependents
.IP \(bu 4
\fBmajor\fR a version exists that is a semver major greater than the current one

In addition to the filtering performed by the pseudo selector, some extra data is added to the resulting objects. The following data can be found under the \fBqueryContext\fR property of each node.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
\fBversions\fR an array of every available version of the given node
.IP \(bu 4
\fBoutdated.inRange\fR an array of objects, each with a \fBfrom\fR and \fBversions\fR, where \fBfrom\fR is the on-disk location of the node that depends on the current node and \fBversions\fR is an array of all available versions that satisfies that dependency. This is only populated if \fB:outdated(in-range)\fR is used.
.IP \(bu 4
\fBoutdated.outOfRange\fR an array of objects, identical in shape to \fBinRange\fR, but where the \fBversions\fR array is every available version that does not satisfy the dependency. This is only populated if \fB:outdated(out-of-range)\fR is used.

.SS "\fBArray\fR & \fBObject\fR Attribute Selectors"
.P
The generic \fB:attr()\fR pseudo selector standardizes a pattern which can be used for attribute selection of \fBObject\fRs, \fBArray\fRs or \fBArrays\fR of \fBObject\fRs accessible via \fBArborist\fR's \fBNode.package\fR metadata. This allows for iterative attribute selection beyond top-level \fBString\fR evaluation. The last argument passed to \fB:attr()\fR must be an \fBattribute\fR selector or a nested \fB:attr()\fR. See examples below:

.SS "\fBArrays\fR"

\fBArray\fRs specifically uses a special/reserved \fB.\fR character in place of a typical attribute name. \fBArrays\fR also support exact \fBvalue\fR matching when a \fBString\fR is passed to the selector.

.RE
.SS "Groups"
.P
Dependency groups are defined by the package relationships to their ancestors (ie. the dependency types that are defined in \fBpackage.json\fR). This approach is user-centric as the ecosystem has been taught to think about dependencies in these groups first-and-foremost. Dependencies are allowed to be included in multiple groups (ex. a \fBprod\fR dependency may also be a \fBdev\fR dependency (in that it's also required by another \fBdev\fR dependency) & may also be \fBbundled\fR - a selector for that type of dependency would look like: \fB*.prod.dev.bundled\fR).
