\fBpackage-spec\fR - Package name specifier
.SS "Description"
.P
Commands like \fBnpm install\fR and the dependency sections in the \fBpackage.json\fR use a package name specifier. This can be many different things that all refer to a "package". Examples include a package name, git url, tarball, or local directory. These will generally be referred to as \fB<package-spec>\fR in the help output for the npm commands that use this package name specifier.

.P
Primarily used by commands like \fBnpm install\fR and in the dependency sections in the \fBpackage.json\fR, this refers to a package by an alias. The \fB<alias>\fR is the name of the package as it is reified in the \fBnode_modules\fR folder, and the \fB<name>\fR refers to a package name as found in the configured registry.
.P
See \fBPackage name\fR above for more info on referring to a package by name, and \fBregistry\fR \fI\(la/using-npm/config#registry\(ra\fR for configuring which registry is used when referring to a package by name.

.P
This refers to a package on the local filesystem. Specifically this is a folder with a \fBpackage.json\fR file in it. This \fIshould\fR always be prefixed with a \fB/\fR or \fB./\fR (or your OS equivalent) to reduce confusion. npm currently will parse a string with more than one \fB/\fR in it as a folder, but this is legacy behavior that may be removed in a future version.
