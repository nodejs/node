\fBscripts\fR \- How npm handles the "scripts" field
.SS Description
.P
The \fB"scripts"\fP property of of your \fBpackage\.json\fP file supports a number of built\-in scripts and their preset life cycle events as well as arbitrary scripts\. These all can be executed by running \fBnpm run\-script <stage>\fP or \fBnpm run <stage>\fP for short\. \fIPre\fR and \fIpost\fR commands with matching names will be run for those as well (e\.g\. \fBpremyscript\fP, \fBmyscript\fP, \fBpostmyscript\fP)\. Scripts from dependencies can be run with \fBnpm explore <pkg> \-\- npm run <stage>\fP\|\.
.SS Pre & Post Scripts
.P
To create "pre" or "post" scripts for any scripts defined in the \fB"scripts"\fP section of the \fBpackage\.json\fP, simply create another script \fIwith a matching name\fR and add "pre" or "post" to the beginning of them\.
.P

{
  "scripts": {
    "precompress": "{{ executes BEFORE the `compress` script }}",
    "compress": "{{ run command to compress files }}",

  }
}

.RE
.SS Life Cycle Scripts
.P
There are some special life cycle scripts that happen only in certain situations\. These scripts happen in addtion to the "pre" and "post" script\.

.RE
.SS Prepare and Prepublish
.P
\fBDeprecation Note: prepublish\fR
.P
Since \fBnpm@1\.1\.71\fP, the npm CLI has run the \fBprepublish\fP script for both \fBnpm publish\fP and \fBnpm install\fP, because it's a convenient way to prepare a package for use (some common use cases are described in the section below)\.  It has also turned out to be, in practice, very confusing \fIhttps://github\.com/npm/npm/issues/10074\fR\|\.  As of \fBnpm@4\.0\.0\fP, a new event has been introduced, \fBprepare\fP, that preserves this existing behavior\. A \fInew\fR event, \fBprepublishOnly\fP has been added as a transitional strategy to allow users to avoid the confusing behavior of existing npm versions and only run on \fBnpm publish\fP (for instance, running the tests one last time to ensure they're in good shape)\.
.P
See https://github\.com/npm/npm/issues/10074 for a much lengthier justification, with further reading, for this change\.
.P
\fBUse Cases\fR
.P
If you need to perform operations on your package before it is used, in a way that is not dependent on the operating system or architecture of the target system, use a \fBprepublish\fP script\. This includes tasks such as:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Compiling CoffeeScript source code into JavaScript\.
.IP \(bu 2
Creating minified versions of JavaScript source code\.
.IP \(bu 2
Fetching remote resources that your package will use\.

.RE
.P
The advantage of doing these things at \fBprepublish\fP time is that they can be done once, in a single place, thus reducing complexity and variability\. Additionally, this means that:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
You can depend on \fBcoffee\-script\fP as a \fBdevDependency\fP, and thus
your users don't need to have it installed\.
.IP \(bu 2
You don't need to include minifiers in your package, reducing
the size for your users\.
.IP \(bu 2
You don't need to rely on your users having \fBcurl\fP or \fBwget\fP or
other system tools on the target machines\.

npm will default some script values based on package contents\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB"start": "node server\.js"\fP:
If there is a \fBserver\.js\fP file in the root of your package, then npm
will default the \fBstart\fP command to \fBnode server\.js\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB"install": "node\-gyp rebuild"\fP:
If there is a \fBbinding\.gyp\fP file in the root of your package and you
haven't defined your own \fBinstall\fP or \fBpreinstall\fP scripts, npm will
default the \fBinstall\fP command to compile using node\-gyp\.

.RE
.SS User
.P
If npm was invoked with root privileges, then it will change the uid
to the user account or uid specified by the \fBuser\fP config, which
defaults to \fBnobody\fP\|\.  Set the \fBunsafe\-perm\fP flag to run scripts with
root privileges\.
.SS Environment
.P
Package scripts run in an environment where many pieces of information
are made available regarding the setup of npm and the current state of
the process\.
.SS path
.P
If you depend on modules that define executable scripts, like test
suites, then those executables will be added to the \fBPATH\fP for
executing the scripts\.  So, if your package\.json has this:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "name" : "foo",
  "dependencies" : {
    "bar" : "0\.1\.x"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start" : "bar \./test"
  }
}
.fi
.RE
.P
then you could run \fBnpm start\fP to execute the \fBbar\fP script, which is
exported into the \fBnode_modules/\.bin\fP directory on \fBnpm install\fP\|\.
.SS package\.json vars
.P
The package\.json fields are tacked onto the \fBnpm_package_\fP prefix\. So,
for instance, if you had \fB{"name":"foo", "version":"1\.2\.5"}\fP in your
package\.json file, then your package scripts would have the
\fBnpm_package_name\fP environment variable set to "foo", and the
\fBnpm_package_version\fP set to "1\.2\.5"\.  You can access these variables 
in your code with \fBprocess\.env\.npm_package_name\fP and 
\fBprocess\.env\.npm_package_version\fP, and so on for other fields\.
.SS configuration
.P
Configuration parameters are put in the environment with the
\fBnpm_config_\fP prefix\. For instance, you can view the effective \fBroot\fP
config by checking the \fBnpm_config_root\fP environment variable\.
.SS Special: package\.json "config" object
.P
The package\.json "config" keys are overwritten in the environment if
there is a config param of \fB<name>[@<version>]:<key>\fP\|\.  For example,
if the package\.json has this:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "name" : "foo",
  "config" : {
    "port" : "8080"
  },
  "scripts" : {
    "start" : "node server\.js"
  }
}
.fi
.RE
.P
and the server\.js is this:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
http\.createServer(\.\.\.)\.listen(process\.env\.npm_package_config_port)
.fi
.RE
.P
then the user could change the behavior by doing:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
  npm config set foo:port 80
.fi
.RE
.SS current lifecycle event
.P
Lastly, the \fBnpm_lifecycle_event\fP environment variable is set to
whichever stage of the cycle is being executed\. So, you could have a
single script used for different parts of the process which switches
based on what's currently happening\.
.P
Objects are flattened following this format, so if you had
\fB{"scripts":{"install":"foo\.js"}}\fP in your package\.json, then you'd
see this in the script:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
process\.env\.npm_package_scripts_install === "foo\.js"
.fi
.RE
.SS Examples
.P
For example, if your package\.json contains this:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "scripts" : {
    "install" : "scripts/install\.js",
    "postinstall" : "scripts/install\.js",
    "uninstall" : "scripts/uninstall\.js"
  }
}
.fi
.RE
.P
then \fBscripts/install\.js\fP will be called for the install
and post\-install stages of the lifecycle, and \fBscripts/uninstall\.js\fP
will be called when the package is uninstalled\.  Since
\fBscripts/install\.js\fP is running for two different phases, it would
be wise in this case to look at the \fBnpm_lifecycle_event\fP environment
variable\.
.P
If you want to run a make command, you can do so\.  This works just
fine:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
{
  "scripts" : {
    "preinstall" : "\./configure",
    "install" : "make && make install",
    "test" : "make test"
  }
}
.fi
.RE
.SS Exiting
.P
Scripts are run by passing the line as a script argument to \fBsh\fP\|\.
.P
If the script exits with a code other than 0, then this will abort the
process\.
.P
Note that these script files don't have to be nodejs or even
javascript programs\. They just have to be some kind of executable
file\.
.SS Hook Scripts
.P
If you want to run a specific script at a specific lifecycle event for
ALL packages, then you can use a hook script\.
.P
Place an executable file at \fBnode_modules/\.hooks/{eventname}\fP, and
it'll get run for all packages when they are going through that point
in the package lifecycle for any packages installed in that root\.
.P
Hook scripts are run exactly the same way as package\.json scripts\.
That is, they are in a separate child process, with the env described
above\.
.SS Best Practices
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Don't exit with a non\-zero error code unless you \fIreally\fR mean it\.
Except for uninstall scripts, this will cause the npm action to
fail, and potentially be rolled back\.  If the failure is minor or
only will prevent some optional features, then it's better to just
print a warning and exit successfully\.
.IP \(bu 2
Try not to use scripts to do what npm can do for you\.  Read through
npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP to see all the things that you can specify and enable
by simply describing your package appropriately\.  In general, this
will lead to a more robust and consistent state\.
.IP \(bu 2
Inspect the env to determine where to put things\.  For instance, if
the \fBnpm_config_binroot\fP environment variable is set to \fB/home/user/bin\fP, then
don't try to install executables into \fB/usr/local/bin\fP\|\.  The user
probably set it up that way for a reason\.
.IP \(bu 2
Don't prefix your script commands with "sudo"\.  If root permissions
are required for some reason, then it'll fail with that error, and
the user will sudo the npm command in question\.
.IP \(bu 2
Don't use \fBinstall\fP\|\. Use a \fB\|\.gyp\fP file for compilation, and \fBprepublish\fP
for anything else\. You should almost never have to explicitly set a
preinstall or install script\. If you are doing this, please consider if
there is another option\. The only valid use of \fBinstall\fP or \fBpreinstall\fP
scripts is for compilation which must be done on the target architecture\.
