.P
The super admin is the only person who can add users to the org because it impacts the monthly bill. The super admin will use the website to manage membership. Every org has a \fBdevelopers\fR team that all users are automatically added to.
.P
The team admin is the person who manages team creation, team membership, and package access for teams. The team admin grants package access to teams, not individuals.
.P
The developer will be able to access packages based on the teams they are on. Access is either read-write or read-only.
.P
There are two main commands:
