$ semver \-h

Usage: semver <version> [<version> [\.\.\.]] [\-r <range> | \-i <inc> | \-\-preid <identifier> | \-l | \-rv]
Test if version(s) satisfy the supplied range(s), and sort them\.

Multiple versions or ranges may be supplied, unless increment
option is specified\.  In that case, only a single version may
be used, and it is incremented by the specified level

Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies
all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions\.

If no versions are valid, or ranges are not satisfied,
then exits failure\.

Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying
multiple versions to the utility will just sort them\.

.RE
.SH Versions
.P
A "version" is described by the \fBv2\.0\.0\fR specification found at
http://semver\.org/\|\.
.P
A leading \fB"="\fR or \fB"v"\fR character is stripped off and ignored\.
.SH Ranges
.P
A \fBversion range\fR is a set of \fBcomparators\fR which specify versions
that satisfy the range\.
.P
A \fBcomparator\fR is composed of an \fBoperator\fR and a \fBversion\fR\|\.  The set
of primitive \fBoperators\fR is:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<\fR Less than
.IP \(bu 2
\fB<=\fR Less than or equal to
.IP \(bu 2
\fB>\fR Greater than
.IP \(bu 2
\fB>=\fR Greater than or equal to
.IP \(bu 2
\fB=\fR Equal\.  If no operator is specified, then equality is assumed,
so this operator is optional, but MAY be included\.

.RE
.P
For example, the comparator \fB>=1\.2\.7\fR would match the versions
\fB1\.2\.7\fR, \fB1\.2\.8\fR, \fB2\.5\.3\fR, and \fB1\.3\.9\fR, but not the versions \fB1\.2\.6\fR
or \fB1\.1\.0\fR\|\.
.P
Comparators can be joined by whitespace to form a \fBcomparator set\fR,
which is satisfied by the \fBintersection\fR of all of the comparators
it includes\.
.P
A range is composed of one or more comparator sets, joined by \fB||\fR\|\.  A
version matches a range if and only if every comparator in at least
one of the \fB||\fR\-separated comparator sets is satisfied by the version\.
.P
For example, the range \fB>=1\.2\.7 <1\.3\.0\fR would match the versions
\fB1\.2\.7\fR, \fB1\.2\.8\fR, and \fB1\.2\.99\fR, but not the versions \fB1\.2\.6\fR, \fB1\.3\.0\fR,
or \fB1\.1\.0\fR\|\.
.P
The range \fB1\.2\.7 || >=1\.2\.9 <2\.0\.0\fR would match the versions \fB1\.2\.7\fR,
\fB1\.2\.9\fR, and \fB1\.4\.6\fR, but not the versions \fB1\.2\.8\fR or \fB2\.0\.0\fR\|\.
.SS Prerelease Tags
.P
If a version has a prerelease tag (for example, \fB1\.2\.3\-alpha\.3\fR) then
it will only be allowed to satisfy comparator sets if at least one
comparator with the same \fB[major, minor, patch]\fR tuple also has a
prerelease tag\.
.P
For example, the range \fB>1\.2\.3\-alpha\.3\fR would be allowed to match the
version \fB1\.2\.3\-alpha\.7\fR, but it would \fInot\fR be satisfied by
\fB3\.4\.5\-alpha\.9\fR, even though \fB3\.4\.5\-alpha\.9\fR is technically "greater
than" \fB1\.2\.3\-alpha\.3\fR according to the SemVer sort rules\.  The version
range only accepts prerelease tags on the \fB1\.2\.3\fR version\.  The
version \fB3\.4\.5\fR \fIwould\fR satisfy the range, because it does not have a
prerelease flag, and \fB3\.4\.5\fR is greater than \fB1\.2\.3\-alpha\.7\fR\|\.
.P
The purpose for this behavior is twofold\.  First, prerelease versions
frequently are updated very quickly, and contain many breaking changes
that are (by the author's design) not yet fit for public consumption\.
Therefore, by default, they are excluded from range matching
semantics\.
.P
Second, a user who has opted into using a prerelease version has
clearly indicated the intent to use \fIthat specific\fR set of
alpha/beta/rc versions\.  By including a prerelease tag in the range,
the user is indicating that they are aware of the risk\.  However, it
is still not appropriate to assume that they have opted into taking a
similar risk on the \fInext\fR set of prerelease versions\.
.SS Prerelease Identifiers
.P
The method \fB\|\.inc\fR takes an additional \fBidentifier\fR string argument that
will append the value of the string as a prerelease identifier:
.P
.RS 2

Which then can be used to increment further:

.RE
.SS Advanced Range Syntax
.P
Advanced range syntax desugars to primitive comparators in
deterministic ways\.
.P
Advanced ranges may be combined in the same way as primitive
comparators using white space or \fB||\fR\|\.

.SS Caret Ranges \fB^1\.2\.3\fR \fB^0\.2\.5\fR \fB^0\.0\.4\fR
.P
Allows changes that do not modify the left\-most non\-zero digit in the
\fB[major, minor, patch]\fR tuple\.  In other words, this allows patch and
minor updates for versions \fB1\.0\.0\fR and above, patch updates for
versions \fB0\.X >=0\.1\.0\fR, and \fIno\fR updates for versions \fB0\.0\.X\fR\|\.
.P
Many authors treat a \fB0\.x\fR version as if the \fBx\fR were the major
"breaking\-change" indicator\.
.P
Caret ranges are ideal when an author may make breaking changes
between \fB0\.2\.4\fR and \fB0\.3\.0\fR releases, which is a common practice\.
However, it presumes that there will \fInot\fR be breaking changes between
\fB0\.2\.4\fR and \fB0\.2\.5\fR\|\.  It allows for changes that are presumed to be
additive (but non\-breaking), according to commonly observed practices\.

Note that, since ranges may be non\-contiguous, a version might not be
greater than a range, less than a range, \fIor\fR satisfy a range!  For
example, the range \fB1\.2 <1\.2\.9 || >2\.0\.0\fR would have a hole from \fB1\.2\.9\fR
until \fB2\.0\.0\fR, so the version \fB1\.2\.10\fR would not be greater than the
range (because \fB2\.0\.1\fR satisfies, which is higher), nor less than the
range (since \fB1\.2\.8\fR satisfies, which is lower), and it also does not
satisfy the range\.
.P
If you want to know if a version satisfies or does not satisfy a
range, use the \fBsatisfies(version, range)\fR function\.
