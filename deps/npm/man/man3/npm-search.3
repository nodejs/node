.P
A search on the registry excludes any result that does not match all of the
search terms\. It also removes any items from the results that contain an
excluded term (the "searchexclude" config)\. The search is case insensitive
and doesn't try to read your mind (it doesn't do any verb tense matching or the
like)\.
