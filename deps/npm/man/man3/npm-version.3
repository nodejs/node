.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Run this in a package directory to bump the version and write the new
data back to the package\.json file\.

If run in a git repo, it will also create a version commit and tag, and
fail if the repo is not clean\.

Like all other commands, this function takes a string array as its first
parameter\. The difference, however, is this function will fail if it does
not have exactly one element\. The only element should be a version number\.
