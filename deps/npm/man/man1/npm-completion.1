.SS "Description"
.P
Enables tab-completion in all npm commands.
.P
The synopsis above loads the completions into your current shell. Adding it to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc will make the completions available everywhere:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm completion >> ~/.bashrc
npm completion >> ~/.zshrc
.fi

You may of course also pipe the output of \fBnpm completion\fR to a file such as \fB/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/npm\fR or \fB/etc/bash_completion.d/npm\fR if you have a system that will read that file for you.
.P
When \fBCOMP_CWORD\fR, \fBCOMP_LINE\fR, and \fBCOMP_POINT\fR are defined in the environment, \fBnpm completion\fR acts in "plumbing mode", and outputs completions based on the arguments.
