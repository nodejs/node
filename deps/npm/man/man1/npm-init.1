.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This will ask you a bunch of questions, and then write a package\.json for you\.
.
.P
It attempts to make reasonable guesses about what you want things to be set to,
and then writes a package\.json file with the options you\'ve selected\.
.
.P
If you already have a package\.json file, it\'ll read that first, and default to
the options in there\.
.
.P
It is strictly additive, so it does not delete options from your package\.json
without a really good reason to do so\.
