\fBnpm-ls\fR - List installed packages
.SS "Synopsis"
.P

npm ls <package-spec>

alias: list
.fi
.RE
.SS "Description"
.P
This command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are installed, as well as their dependencies when \fB--all\fR is specified, in a tree structure.
.P
Note: to get a "bottoms up" view of why a given package is included in the tree at all, use npm help explain.
.P
Positional arguments are \fBname@version-range\fR identifiers, which will limit the results to only the paths to the packages named. Note that nested packages will \fIalso\fR show the paths to the specified packages. For example, running \fBnpm ls promzard\fR in npm's source tree will show:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm@9.6.2 /path/to/npm
└─┬ init-package-json@0.0.4
  └── promzard@0.1.5
.fi
.RE
.P
It will print out extraneous, missing, and invalid packages.
.P
If a project specifies git urls for dependencies these are shown in parentheses after the \fBname@version\fR to make it easier for users to recognize potential forks of a project.
.P
The tree shown is the logical dependency tree, based on package dependencies, not the physical layout of your \fBnode_modules\fR folder.
.P
When run as \fBll\fR or \fBla\fR, it shows extended information by default.
.SS "Note: Design Changes Pending"
.P
The \fBnpm ls\fR command's output and behavior made a \fIton\fR of sense when npm created a \fBnode_modules\fR folder that naively nested every dependency. In such a case, the logical dependency graph and physical tree of packages on disk would be roughly identical.
.P
With the advent of automatic install-time deduplication of dependencies in npm v3, the \fBls\fR output was modified to display the logical dependency graph as a tree structure, since this was more useful to most users. However, without using \fBnpm ls -l\fR, it became impossible to show \fIwhere\fR a package was actually installed much of the time!
.P
With the advent of automatic installation of \fBpeerDependencies\fR in npm v7, this gets even more curious, as \fBpeerDependencies\fR are logically "underneath" their dependents in the dependency graph, but are always physically at or above their location on disk.
.P
Also, in the years since npm got an \fBls\fR command (in version 0.0.2!), dependency graphs have gotten much larger as a general rule. Therefore, in order to avoid dumping an excessive amount of content to the terminal, \fBnpm
ls\fR now only shows the \fItop\fR level dependencies, unless \fB--all\fR is provided.
.P
A thorough re-examination of the use cases, intention, behavior, and output of this command, is currently underway. Expect significant changes to at least the default human-readable \fBnpm ls\fR output in npm v8.

Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the \fBprefix\fR folder instead of the current working directory. See npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior.

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk.

Note that these dependencies \fIare\fR still resolved and added to the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR or \fBnpm-shrinkwrap.json\fR file. They are just not physically installed on disk.
.P
If a package type appears in both the \fB--include\fR and \fB--omit\fR lists, then it will be included.

If set to true, the current operation will only use the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR, ignoring \fBnode_modules\fR.

For \fBupdate\fR this means only the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR will be updated, instead of checking \fBnode_modules\fR and downloading dependencies.
