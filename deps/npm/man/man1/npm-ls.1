\fBnpm-ls\fR \- List installed packages
.SS Synopsis

.nf
npm ls [[<@scope>/]<pkg> \.\.\.]

aliases: list, la, ll

.SS Description
.P
This command will print to stdout all the versions of packages that are
installed, as well as their dependencies when \fB\-\-all\fP is specified, in a
tree structure\.
.P
Note: to get a "bottoms up" view of why a given package is included in the
tree at all, use npm help \fBexplain\fP\|\.
.P
Positional arguments are \fBname@version\-range\fP identifiers, which will limit
the results to only the paths to the packages named\.  Note that nested
packages will \fIalso\fR show the paths to the specified packages\.  For
example, running \fBnpm ls promzard\fP in npm's source tree will show:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm@7\.3\.0 /path/to/npm
└─┬ init\-package\-json@0\.0\.4
  └── promzard@0\.1\.5

.P
It will print out extraneous, missing, and invalid packages\.
.P
If a project specifies git urls for dependencies these are shown
in parentheses after the name@version to make it easier for users to
recognize potential forks of a project\.
.P
The tree shown is the logical dependency tree, based on package
dependencies, not the physical layout of your \fBnode_modules\fP folder\.
.P
When run as \fBll\fP or \fBla\fP, it shows extended information by default\.
.SS Note: Design Changes Pending
.P
The \fBnpm ls\fP command's output and behavior made a \fIton\fR of sense when npm
created a \fBnode_modules\fP folder that naively nested every dependency\.  In
such a case, the logical dependency graph and physical tree of packages on
disk would be roughly identical\.
.P
With the advent of automatic install\-time deduplication of dependencies in
npm v3, the \fBls\fP output was modified to display the logical dependency
graph as a tree structure, since this was more useful to most users\.
However, without using \fBnpm ls \-l\fP, it became impossible show \fIwhere\fR a
package was actually installed much of the time!
.P
With the advent of automatic installation of \fBpeerDependencies\fP in npm v7,
this gets even more curious, as \fBpeerDependencies\fP are logically
"underneath" their dependents in the dependency graph, but are always
physically at or above their location on disk\.
.P
Also, in the years since npm got an \fBls\fP command (in version 0\.0\.2!),
dependency graphs have gotten much larger as a general rule\.  Therefor, in
order to avoid dumping an excessive amount of content to the terminal, \fBnpm
ls\fP now only shows the \fItop\fR level dependencies, unless \fB\-\-all\fP is
provided\.
.P
A thorough re\-examination of the use cases, intention, behavior, and output
of this command, is currently underway\.  Expect significant changes to at
least the default human\-readable \fBnpm ls\fP output in npm v8\.
