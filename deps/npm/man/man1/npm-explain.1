.SS "Description"
.P
This command will print the chain of dependencies causing a given package to be installed in the current project.
.P
If one or more package specs are provided, then only packages matching one of the specifiers will have their relationships explained.
.P
The package spec can also refer to a folder within \fB./node_modules\fR
.P
For example, running \fBnpm explain glob\fR within npm's source tree will show:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
glob@7.1.6
node_modules/glob
  glob@"^7.1.4" from the root project

glob@7.1.1 dev
node_modules/tacks/node_modules/glob
  glob@"^7.0.5" from rimraf@2.6.2
  node_modules/tacks/node_modules/rimraf
    rimraf@"^2.6.2" from tacks@1.3.0
    node_modules/tacks
      dev tacks@"^1.3.0" from the root project

.P
To explain just the package residing at a specific folder, pass that as the argument to the command. This can be useful when trying to figure out exactly why a given dependency is being duplicated to satisfy conflicting version requirements within the project.

$ npm explain node_modules/nyc/node_modules/find-up
