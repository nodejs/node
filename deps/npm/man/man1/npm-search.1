npm search [\-l|\-\-long] [\-\-json] [\-\-parseable] [\-\-no\-description] [search terms \.\.\.]

aliases: s, se, find

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces\.
.SS Description
.P
Search the registry for packages matching the search terms\. \fBnpm search\fP
performs a linear, incremental, lexically\-ordered search through package
metadata for all files in the registry\. If your terminal has color
support, it will further highlight the matches in the results\.  This can
be disabled with the config item \fBcolor\fP
.P
Additionally, using the \fB\-\-searchopts\fP and \fB\-\-searchexclude\fP options
paired with more search terms will include and exclude further patterns\.
The main difference between \fB\-\-searchopts\fP and the standard search terms
is that the former does not highlight results in the output and you can
use them more fine\-grained filtering\. Additionally, you can add both of
these to your config to change default search filtering behavior\.
.P
Search also allows targeting of maintainers in search results, by prefixing
their npm username with \fB=\fP\|\.
.P
If a term starts with \fB/\fP, then it's interpreted as a regular expression
and supports standard JavaScript RegExp syntax\. In this case search will
ignore a trailing \fB/\fP \.  (Note you must escape or quote many regular
expression characters in most shells\.)
.SS Configuration
.P
All of the following can be defined in a \fB\|\.npmrc\fP file, or passed as
parameters to the cli prefixed with \fB\-\-\fP (e\.g\. \fB\-\-json\fP)

Display full package descriptions and other long text across multiple
lines\. When disabled (which is the default) the output will
truncate search results to fit neatly on a single line\. Modules with
extremely long names will fall on multiple lines\.

.RE
.P
Search the specified registry for modules\. If you have configured npm to
point to a different default registry (such as your internal private
module repository), \fBnpm search\fP will also default to that registry when
searching\.
.SS A note on caching
.P
The npm cli caches search results with the same terms and options
locally in its cache\. You can use the following to change how and when
the cli uses this cache\. See npm help \fBcache\fP for more
on how the cache works\.
.SS prefer\-online
.P
Forces staleness checks for cached searches, making the cli look for
updates immediately even for fresh search results\.
.SS prefer\-offline
.P
Bypasses staleness checks for cached searches\.  Missing data will still
be requested from the server\. To force full offline mode, use \fBoffline\fP\|\.
.SS offline
.P
Forces full offline mode\. Any searches not locally cached will result in
an error\.
