.SS "Description"
.P
Used to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships. Does not handle permissions for packages.
.P
Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to when operating on them, separated by a colon (\fB:\fR). That is, if you have a \fBnewteam\fR team in an \fBorg\fR organization, you must always refer to that team as \fB@org:newteam\fR in these commands.
.P
If you have two-factor authentication enabled in \fBauth-and-writes\fR mode, then you can provide a code from your authenticator with \fB\[lB]--otp <otpcode>\[rB]\fR. If you don't include this then you will be taken through a second factor flow based on your \fBauthtype\fR.
