Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to
when operating on them, separated by a colon (\fB:\fP)\. That is, if you have a
\fBnewteam\fP team in an \fBorg\fP organization, you must always refer to that team
as \fB@org:newteam\fP in these commands\.
.P
If you have two\-factor authentication enabled in \fBauth\-and\-writes\fP mode, then
you can provide a code from your authenticator with \fB[\-\-otp <otpcode>]\fP\|\.
If you don't include this then you will be prompted\.

.SS Details
.P
\fBnpm team\fP always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from
the command line using \fB\-\-registry=<registry url>\fP\|\.
.P
You must be a \fIteam admin\fR to create teams and manage team membership, under
the given organization\. Listing teams and team memberships may be done by
any member of the organization\.
.P
Organization creation and management of team admins and \fIorganization\fR members
is done through the website, not the npm CLI\.
.P
To use teams to manage permissions on packages belonging to your organization,
use the \fBnpm access\fP command to grant or revoke the appropriate permissions\.
