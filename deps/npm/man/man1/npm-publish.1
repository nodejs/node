.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Publishes a package to the registry so that it can be installed by name\. All
files in the package directory are included if no local \fB\|\.gitignore\fP or
\fB\|\.npmignore\fP file is present\. See npm help 7 \fBnpm\-developers\fP for full details on
what's included in the published package, as well as details on how the package
is built\.
.P
By default npm will publish to the public registry\. This can be overridden by
specifying a different default registry or using a npm help 7 \fBnpm\-scope\fP in the name
(see npm help 5 \fBpackage\.json\fP)\.
