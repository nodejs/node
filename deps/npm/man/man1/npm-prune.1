.SS Description
.P
This command removes "extraneous" packages\.  If a package name is provided,
then only packages matching one of the supplied names are removed\.
.P
Extraneous packages are those present in the \fBnode_modules\fP folder that are
not listed as any package's dependency list\.
.P
If the \fB\-\-production\fP flag is specified or the \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment
variable is set to \fBproduction\fP, this command will remove the packages
specified in your \fBdevDependencies\fP\|\. Setting \fB\-\-no\-production\fP will negate
\fBNODE_ENV\fP being set to \fBproduction\fP\|\.
.P
If the \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP flag is used then no changes will actually be made\.
.P
If the \fB\-\-json\fP flag is used, then the changes \fBnpm prune\fP made (or would
have made with \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP) are printed as a JSON object\.
.P
In normal operation, extraneous modules are pruned automatically, so you'll
only need this command with the \fB\-\-production\fP flag\.  However, in the real
world, operation is not always "normal"\.  When crashes or mistakes happen,
this command can help clean up any resulting garbage\.
