\fBnpm-prune\fR \- Remove extraneous packages

.SS Description
.P
This command removes "extraneous" packages\.  If a package name is provided,
then only packages matching one of the supplied names are removed\.
.P
Extraneous packages are those present in the \fBnode_modules\fP folder that are
not listed as any package's dependency list\.
.P
If the \fB\-\-production\fP flag is specified or the \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment
variable is set to \fBproduction\fP, this command will remove the packages
specified in your \fBdevDependencies\fP\|\. Setting \fB\-\-no\-production\fP will negate
\fBNODE_ENV\fP being set to \fBproduction\fP\|\.
.P
If the \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP flag is used then no changes will actually be made\.
.P
If the \fB\-\-json\fP flag is used, then the changes \fBnpm prune\fP made (or would
have made with \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP) are printed as a JSON object\.
.P
In normal operation, extraneous modules are pruned automatically, so you'll
only need this command with the \fB\-\-production\fP flag\.  However, in the real
world, operation is not always "normal"\.  When crashes or mistakes happen,
this command can help clean up any resulting garbage\.

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk\.
.P
Note that these dependencies \fIare\fR still resolved and added to the
\fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP or \fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP file\. They are just not
physically installed on disk\.
.P
If a package type appears in both the \fB\-\-include\fP and \fB\-\-omit\fP lists, then
it will be included\.
.P
If the resulting omit list includes \fB\|'dev'\fP, then the \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment
variable will be set to \fB\|'production'\fP for all lifecycle scripts\.

.P
Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done\. This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, \fBinstall\fP, \fBupdate\fP,
\fBdedupe\fP, \fBuninstall\fP, as well as \fBpack\fP and \fBpublish\fP\|\.
.P
Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg \fBdist\-tags\fP,
\fBowner\fP, etc\.

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output\.

.IP \(bu 2
In \fBnpm pkg set\fP it enables parsing set values with JSON\.parse() before
saving them to your \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\.

Not supported by all npm commands\.

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option\.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fP config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
workspaces within that folder)

.RE
.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fP command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.

.RE
.P
Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured
workspaces\.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fP to
ignore workspaces altogether\. When not set explicitly:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fP tree (install, update, etc\.)
will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fP folder\. \- Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc\.) will operate on the root project,
\fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fP config\.

.RE
.P
Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command\.
.P
When false, specifying individual workspaces via the \fBworkspace\fP config, or
all workspaces via the \fBworkspaces\fP flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project\.
