Note: This command is unaware of workspaces\.
.SS Description
.P
Manage ownership of published packages\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
ls: List all the users who have access to modify a package and push new
versions\.  Handy when you need to know who to bug for help\.
.IP \(bu 2
add: Add a new user as a maintainer of a package\.  This user is enabled
to modify metadata, publish new versions, and add other owners\.
.IP \(bu 2
rm: Remove a user from the package owner list\.  This immediately revokes
their privileges\.

.RE
.P
Note that there is only one level of access\.  Either you can modify a package,
or you can't\.  Future versions may contain more fine\-grained access levels, but
that is not implemented at this time\.
.P
If you have two\-factor authentication enabled with \fBauth\-and\-writes\fP (see
npm help npm\-profile) then you'll need to include an otp
on the command line when changing ownership with \fB\-\-otp\fP\|\.
.SS Configuration
.SS \fBregistry\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: "https://registry\.npmjs\.org/"

The base URL of the npm registry\.
.SS \fBotp\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: null
.IP \(bu 2
Type: null or String

.RE
.P
This is a one\-time password from a two\-factor authenticator\. It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with \fBnpm access\fP\|\.
.P
If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one\-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one\.
.SS \fBworkspace\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default:
.IP \(bu 2
Type: String (can be set multiple times)

.RE
.P
Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option\.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fP config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
workspaces within that folder)

.RE
.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fP command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
.SS \fBworkspaces\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: null
.IP \(bu 2
Type: null or Boolean

.RE
.P
Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured
workspaces\.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fP to
ignore workspaces altogether\. When not set explicitly:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fP tree (install, update, etc\.)
will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fP folder\. \- Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc\.) will operate on the root project,
\fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fP config\.
