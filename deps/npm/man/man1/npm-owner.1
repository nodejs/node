Note that there is only one level of access\.  Either you can modify a package,
or you can't\.  Future versions may contain more fine\-grained access levels, but
that is not implemented at this time\.
.P
If you have two\-factor authentication enabled with \fBauth\-and\-writes\fP then
you'll need to include an otp on the command line when changing ownership
with \fB\-\-otp\fP\|\.
