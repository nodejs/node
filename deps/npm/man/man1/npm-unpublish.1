\fBnpm-unpublish\fR \- Remove a package from the registry
.SS Synopsis

npm unpublish [<package\-spec>]

To learn more about how the npm registry treats unpublish, see our <a
href="https://docs\.npmjs\.com/policies/unpublish" target="_blank"
rel="noopener noreferrer"> unpublish policies</a>
.SS Warning
.P
Consider using the npm help \fBdeprecate\fP command instead,
if your intent is to encourage users to upgrade, or if you no longer
want to maintain a package\.
.SS Description
.P
This removes a package version from the registry, deleting its entry and
removing the tarball\.
.P
The npm registry will return an error if you are not npm help logged
in\.
.P
If you do not specify a version or if you remove all of a package's
versions then the registry will remove the root package entry entirely\.
.P
Even if you unpublish a package version, that specific name and version
combination can never be reused\. In order to publish the package again,
you must use a new version number\. If you unpublish the entire package,
you may not publish any new versions of that package until 24 hours have
passed\.

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option\.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fP config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
workspaces within that folder)

.RE
.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fP command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.

Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured
workspaces\.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fP to
ignore workspaces altogether\. When not set explicitly:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fP tree (install, update, etc\.)
will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fP folder\. \- Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc\.) will operate on the root project,
\fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fP config\.
