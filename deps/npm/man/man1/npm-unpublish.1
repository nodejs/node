\fBnpm-unpublish\fR - Remove a package from the registry

.RE
.P
To learn more about how the npm registry treats unpublish, see our \fBunpublish policies\fR \fI\(lahttps://docs.npmjs.com/policies/unpublish\(ra\fR.
.SS "Warning"
.P
Consider using the npm help deprecate command instead, if your intent is to encourage users to upgrade, or if you no longer want to maintain a package.
.SS "Description"
.P
This removes a package version from the registry, deleting its entry and removing the tarball.
.P
The npm registry will return an error if you are not npm help "logged in".
.P
If you do not specify a package name at all, the name and version to be unpublished will be pulled from the project in the current directory.
.P
If you specify a package name but do not specify a version or if you remove all of a package's versions then the registry will remove the root package entry entirely.
.P
Even if you unpublish a package version, that specific name and version combination can never be reused. In order to publish the package again, you must use a new version number. If you unpublish the entire package, you may not publish any new versions of that package until 24 hours have passed.

.P
Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should only report what it would have done. This can be passed into any of the commands that modify your local installation, eg, \fBinstall\fR, \fBupdate\fR, \fBdedupe\fR, \fBuninstall\fR, as well as \fBpack\fR and \fBpublish\fR.

Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg \fBdist-tags\fR, \fBowner\fR, etc.

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by this configuration option.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fR config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all workspaces within that folder)

When set for the \fBnpm init\fR command, this may be set to the folder of a workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a brand new workspace within the project.

Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured workspaces.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fR to ignore workspaces altogether. When not set explicitly:

.IP \(bu 4
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fR tree (install, update, etc.) will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fR folder. - Commands that do other things (test, exec, publish, etc.) will operate on the root project, \fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fR config.
