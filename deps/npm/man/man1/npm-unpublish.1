.SS Warning
.P
Consider using the npm help \fBdeprecate\fP command instead,
if your intent is to encourage users to upgrade, or if you no longer
want to maintain a package\.
.SS Description
.P
This removes a package version from the registry, deleting its entry and
removing the tarball\.
.P
The npm registry will return an error if you are not npm help logged
in\.
.P
If you do not specify a version or if you remove all of a package's
versions then the registry will remove the root package entry entirely\.
.P
Even if you unpublish a package version, that specific name and version
combination can never be reused\. In order to publish the package again,
you must use a new version number\. If you unpublish the entire package,
you may not publish any new versions of that package until 24 hours have
passed\.
