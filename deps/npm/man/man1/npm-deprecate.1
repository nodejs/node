Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.
.SS "Description"
.P
This command will update the npm registry entry for a package, providing a deprecation warning to all who attempt to install it.
.P
It works on \fBversion ranges\fR \fI\(lahttps://semver.npmjs.com/\(ra\fR as well as specific versions, so you can do something like this:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm deprecate my-thing@"< 0.2.3" "critical bug fixed in v0.2.3"
.fi
.RE
.P
SemVer ranges passed to this command are interpreted such that they \fIdo\fR include prerelease versions. For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm deprecate my-thing@1.x "1.x is no longer supported"
.fi
.RE
.P
In this case, a version \fBmy-thing@1.0.0-beta.0\fR will also be deprecated.
.P
You must be the package owner to deprecate something. See the \fBowner\fR and \fBadduser\fR help topics.
.P
To un-deprecate a package, specify an empty string (\fB""\fR) for the \fBmessage\fR argument. Note that you must use double quotes with no space between them to format an empty string.

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should only report what it would have done. This can be passed into any of the commands that modify your local installation, eg, \fBinstall\fR, \fBupdate\fR, \fBdedupe\fR, \fBuninstall\fR, as well as \fBpack\fR and \fBpublish\fR.
.P
Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg \fBdist-tags\fR, \fBowner\fR, etc.
