.SS "Description"
.P
This command will update the npm registry entry for a package, providing a deprecation warning to all who attempt to install it.
.P
It works on \fBversion ranges\fR \fI\(lahttps://semver.npmjs.com/\(ra\fR as well as specific versions, so you can do something like this:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm deprecate my-thing@"< 0.2.3" "critical bug fixed in v0.2.3"
.fi
.RE
.P
SemVer ranges passed to this command are interpreted such that they \fIdo\fR include prerelease versions. For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm deprecate my-thing@1.x "1.x is no longer supported"
.fi
.RE
.P
In this case, a version \fBmy-thing@1.0.0-beta.0\fR will also be deprecated.
.P
You must be the package owner to deprecate something. See the \fBowner\fR and \fBadduser\fR help topics.
.P
To un-deprecate a package, specify an empty string (\fB""\fR) for the \fBmessage\fR argument. Note that you must use double quotes with no space between them to format an empty string.
