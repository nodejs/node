This command runs an \fBnpm install\fR followed immediately by an \fBnpm test\fR. It takes exactly the same arguments as \fBnpm install\fR.

.P
Save installed packages to a \fBpackage.json\fR file as dependencies.
.P
When used with the \fBnpm rm\fR command, removes the dependency from \fBpackage.json\fR.
.P
Will also prevent writing to \fBpackage-lock.json\fR if set to \fBfalse\fR.

Dependencies saved to package.json will be configured with an exact version rather than using npm's default semver range operator.

.IP \(bu 4

.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean

.P
Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the \fBprefix\fR folder instead of the current working directory. See npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior.

.IP \(bu 4
packages are installed into the \fB{prefix}/lib/node_modules\fR folder, instead of the current working directory.

.IP \(bu 4
Type: "hoisted", "nested", "shallow", or "linked"
.RE 0

.P
Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules. hoisted (default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary within directory structure. nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in place, no hoisting. shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct deps at top-level. linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/.store, link in place, unhoisted.

.IP \(bu 4

.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.IP \(bu 4
DEPRECATED: This option has been deprecated in favor of \fB--install-strategy=nested\fR
.RE 0

.P
Instead of hoisting package installs in \fBnode_modules\fR, install packages in the same manner that they are depended on. This may cause very deep directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no de-duplicating. Sets \fB--install-strategy=nested\fR.

.P
Only install direct dependencies in the top level \fBnode_modules\fR, but hoist on deeper dependencies. Sets \fB--install-strategy=shallow\fR.
.SS "\fBomit\fR"

.IP \(bu 4
Default: 'dev' if the \fBNODE_ENV\fR environment variable is set to 'production', otherwise empty.
.IP \(bu 4
Type: "dev", "optional", or "peer" (can be set multiple times)
.RE 0

.P
Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk.
.P
Note that these dependencies \fIare\fR still resolved and added to the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR or \fBnpm-shrinkwrap.json\fR file. They are just not physically installed on disk.
.P
If a package type appears in both the \fB--include\fR and \fB--omit\fR lists, then it will be included.
.P
If the resulting omit list includes \fB'dev'\fR, then the \fBNODE_ENV\fR environment variable will be set to \fB'production'\fR for all lifecycle scripts.
.SS "\fBinclude\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Default:
.IP \(bu 4
Type: "prod", "dev", "optional", or "peer" (can be set multiple times)
.RE 0

.P
Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install.
.P
This is the inverse of \fB--omit=<type>\fR.
.P
Dependency types specified in \fB--include\fR will not be omitted, regardless of the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line.
.SS "\fBstrict-peer-deps\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Default: false
.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.RE 0

.P
If set to \fBtrue\fR, and \fB--legacy-peer-deps\fR is not set, then \fIany\fR conflicting \fBpeerDependencies\fR will be treated as an install failure, even if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer dependency relationships.
.P
By default, conflicting \fBpeerDependencies\fR deep in the dependency graph will be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside the range set in their package's \fBpeerDependencies\fR object.
.P
When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the conflict and the packages involved. If \fB--strict-peer-deps\fR is set, then this warning is treated as a failure.
.SS "\fBprefer-dedupe\fR"

Prefer to deduplicate packages if possible, rather than choosing a newer version of a dependency.
.SS "\fBpackage-lock\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Default: true
.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.RE 0

.P
If set to false, then ignore \fBpackage-lock.json\fR files when installing. This will also prevent \fIwriting\fR \fBpackage-lock.json\fR if \fBsave\fR is true.
.SS "\fBpackage-lock-only\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Default: false
.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.RE 0

.P
If set to true, the current operation will only use the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR, ignoring \fBnode_modules\fR.
.P
For \fBupdate\fR this means only the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR will be updated, instead of checking \fBnode_modules\fR and downloading dependencies.
.P
For \fBlist\fR this means the output will be based on the tree described by the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR, rather than the contents of \fBnode_modules\fR.

.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.RE 0

.P
Run all build scripts (ie, \fBpreinstall\fR, \fBinstall\fR, and \fBpostinstall\fR) scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard input, output, and error with the main npm process.
.P
Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier, but can be useful for debugging.
.SS "\fBignore-scripts\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Default: false
.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.RE 0

.P
If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.
.P
Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as \fBnpm start\fR, \fBnpm stop\fR, \fBnpm restart\fR, \fBnpm test\fR, and \fBnpm run\fR will still run their intended script if \fBignore-scripts\fR is set, but they will \fInot\fR run any pre- or post-scripts.

When "true" submit audit reports alongside the current npm command to the default registry and all registries configured for scopes. See the documentation for npm help audit for details on what is submitted.
.SS "\fBbefore\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4

.IP \(bu 4
Type: null or Date

.P
If passed to \fBnpm install\fR, will rebuild the npm tree such that only versions that were available \fBon or before\fR the given date are installed. If there are no versions available for the current set of dependencies, the command will error.
.P
If the requested version is a \fBdist-tag\fR and the given tag does not pass the \fB--before\fR filter, the most recent version less than or equal to that tag will be used. For example, \fBfoo@latest\fR might install \fBfoo@1.2\fR even though \fBlatest\fR is \fB2.0\fR.

.P
Tells npm to create symlinks (or \fB.cmd\fR shims on Windows) for package executables.
.P
Set to false to have it not do this. This can be used to work around the fact that some file systems don't support symlinks, even on ostensibly Unix systems.
.SS "\fBfund\fR"

.IP \(bu 4
Default: true
.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean

When "true" displays the message at the end of each \fBnpm install\fR acknowledging the number of dependencies looking for funding. See npm help fund for details.
.SS "\fBdry-run\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Default: false
.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.RE 0

.P
Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should only report what it would have done. This can be passed into any of the commands that modify your local installation, eg, \fBinstall\fR, \fBupdate\fR, \fBdedupe\fR, \fBuninstall\fR, as well as \fBpack\fR and \fBpublish\fR.
.P
Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg \fBdist-tags\fR, \fBowner\fR, etc.

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by this configuration option.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fR config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all workspaces within that folder)
.RE 0

.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fR command, this may be set to the folder of a workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a brand new workspace within the project.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured workspaces.

Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fR to ignore workspaces altogether. When not set explicitly:

Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fR tree (install, update, etc.) will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fR folder. - Commands that do other things (test, exec, publish, etc.) will operate on the root project, \fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fR config.

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command.
.P
When false, specifying individual workspaces via the \fBworkspace\fR config, or all workspaces via the \fBworkspaces\fR flag, will cause npm to operate only on the specified workspaces, and not on the root project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.
