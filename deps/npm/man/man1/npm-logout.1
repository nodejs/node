Note: This command is unaware of workspaces\.
.SS Description
.P
When logged into a registry that supports token\-based authentication, tell
the server to end this token's session\. This will invalidate the token
everywhere you're using it, not just for the current environment\.
.P
When logged into a legacy registry that uses username and password
authentication, this will clear the credentials in your user configuration\.
In this case, it will \fIonly\fR affect the current environment\.
.P
If \fB\-\-scope\fP is provided, this will find the credentials for the registry
connected to that scope, if set\.

npm login \-\-scope=@mycorp \-\-registry=https://registry\.mycorp\.com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token

installation of packages specified according to the pattern
\fB@mycorp/package\fP\|\.

# instead of just named "whatever"
