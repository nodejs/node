.P
Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done\. This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, \fBinstall\fP, \fBupdate\fP,
\fBdedupe\fP, \fBuninstall\fP, as well as \fBpack\fP and \fBpublish\fP\|\.
.P
Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg \fBdist\-tags\fP,
\fBowner\fP, etc\.

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output\.

.IP \(bu 2
In \fBnpm pkg set\fP it enables parsing set values with JSON\.parse() before
saving them to your \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\.

Not supported by all npm commands\.

.RE
.P
Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option\.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fP config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 2
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
workspaces within that folder)

.RE
.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fP command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
.SS \fBworkspaces\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: null
.IP \(bu 2
Type: null or Boolean

.RE
.P
Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured
workspaces\.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fP to
ignore workspaces altogether\. When not set explicitly:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fP tree (install, update, etc\.)
will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fP folder\. \- Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc\.) will operate on the root project,
\fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fP config\.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
.SS \fBinclude\-workspace\-root\fP
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Default: false
.IP \(bu 2
Type: Boolean

.RE
.P
Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command\.
.P
When false, specifying individual workspaces via the \fBworkspace\fP config, or
all workspaces via the \fBworkspaces\fP flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project\.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes\.
.SS Description
.P
For anything that's installable (that is, a package folder, tarball,
tarball url, git url, name@tag, name@version, name, or scoped name), this
command will fetch it to the cache, copy the tarball to the current working
directory as \fB<name>\-<version>\.tgz\fP, and then write the filenames out to
stdout\.
.P
If the same package is specified multiple times, then the file will be
overwritten the second time\.
.P
If no arguments are supplied, then npm packs the current package folder\.
