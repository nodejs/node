.SS "Description"
.P
This command retrieves information on how to fund the dependencies of a given project. If no package name is provided, it will list all dependencies that are looking for funding in a tree structure, listing the type of funding and the url to visit. If a package name is provided then it tries to open its funding url using the \fB\fB--browser\fR config\fR \fI\(la/using-npm/config#browser\(ra\fR param; if there are multiple funding sources for the package, the user will be instructed to pass the \fB--which\fR option to disambiguate.
.P
The list will avoid duplicated entries and will stack all packages that share the same url as a single entry. Thus, the list does not have the same shape of the output from \fBnpm ls\fR.
.SS "Example"
.SS "Workspaces support"
.P
It's possible to filter the results to only include a single workspace and its dependencies using the \fB\fBworkspace\fR config\fR \fI\(la/using-npm/config#workspace\(ra\fR option.
.SS "Example:"
.P
Here's an example running \fBnpm fund\fR in a project with a configured workspace \fBa\fR:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
$ npm fund
test-workspaces-fund@1.0.0
+-- https://example.com/a
| | `-- a@1.0.0
| `-- https://example.com/maintainer
|     `-- foo@1.0.0
+-- https://example.com/npmcli-funding
|   `-- @npmcli/test-funding
`-- https://example.com/org
    `-- bar@2.0.0
.fi
.RE
.P
And here is an example of the expected result when filtering only by a specific workspace \fBa\fR in the same project:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
$ npm fund -w a
test-workspaces-fund@1.0.0
`-- https://example.com/a
  | `-- a@1.0.0
  `-- https://example.com/maintainer
      `-- foo@2.0.0

.P
Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by this configuration option.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fR config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all workspaces within that folder)
.RE 0

.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fR command, this may be set to the folder of a workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a brand new workspace within the project.
.P
This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.
