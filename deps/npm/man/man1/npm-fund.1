.SS Description
.P
This command retrieves information on how to fund the dependencies of
a given project\. If no package name is provided, it will list all
dependencies that are looking for funding in a tree\-structure in which
are listed the type of funding and the url to visit\. If a package name
is provided then it tries to open its funding url using the \fB\-\-browser\fP
config param; if there are multiple funding sources for the package, the
user will be instructed to pass the \fB\-\-which\fP command to disambiguate\.
.P
The list will avoid duplicated entries and will stack all packages
that share the same type/url as a single entry\. Given this nature the
list is not going to have the same shape of the output from \fBnpm ls\fP\|\.
