\fBnpm-audit\fR - Run a security audit
.SS "Synopsis"
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm audit \[lB]fix|signatures\[rB]
.fi
.RE
.SS "Description"
.P
The audit command submits a description of the dependencies configured in your project to your default registry and asks for a report of known vulnerabilities. If any vulnerabilities are found, then the impact and appropriate remediation will be calculated. If the \fBfix\fR argument is provided, then remediations will be applied to the package tree.
.P
The command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities were found.
.P
Note that some vulnerabilities cannot be fixed automatically and will require manual intervention or review. Also note that since \fBnpm audit
fix\fR runs a full-fledged \fBnpm install\fR under the hood, all configs that apply to the installer will also apply to \fBnpm install\fR -- so things like \fBnpm audit fix --package-lock-only\fR will work as expected.
.P
By default, the audit command will exit with a non-zero code if any vulnerability is found. It may be useful in CI environments to include the \fB--audit-level\fR parameter to specify the minimum vulnerability level that will cause the command to fail. This option does not filter the report output, it simply changes the command's failure threshold.
.SS "Package lock"
.P
By default npm requires a package-lock or shrinkwrap in order to run the audit. You can bypass the package lock with \fB--no-package-lock\fR but be aware the results may be different with every run, since npm will re-build the dependency tree each time.
.SS "Audit Signatures"
.P
To ensure the integrity of packages you download from the public npm registry, or any registry that supports signatures, you can verify the registry signatures of downloaded packages using the npm CLI.
.P
Registry signatures can be verified using the following \fBaudit\fR command:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
$ npm audit signatures
.fi
.RE
.P
The \fBaudit signatures\fR command will also verify the provenance attestations of downloaded packages. Because provenance attestations are such a new feature, security features may be added to (or changed in) the attestation format over time. To ensure that you're always able to verify attestation signatures check that you're running the latest version of the npm CLI. Please note this often means updating npm beyond the version that ships with Node.js.
.P
The npm CLI supports registry signatures and signing keys provided by any registry if the following conventions are followed:

.SS "Audit Endpoints"
.P
There are two audit endpoints that npm may use to fetch vulnerability information: the \fBBulk Advisory\fR endpoint and the \fBQuick Audit\fR endpoint.
.SS "Bulk Advisory Endpoint"
.P
As of version 7, npm uses the much faster \fBBulk Advisory\fR endpoint to optimize the speed of calculating audit results.
.P
npm will generate a JSON payload with the name and list of versions of each package in the tree, and POST it to the default configured registry at the path \fB/-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk\fR.
.P
Any packages in the tree that do not have a \fBversion\fR field in their package.json file will be ignored. If any \fB--omit\fR options are specified (either via the \fB\fB--omit\fR config\fR \fI\(la/using-npm/config#omit\(ra\fR, or one of the shorthands such as \fB--production\fR, \fB--only=dev\fR, and so on), then packages will be omitted from the submitted payload as appropriate.
.P
If the registry responds with an error, or with an invalid response, then npm will attempt to load advisory data from the \fBQuick Audit\fR endpoint.
.P
The expected result will contain a set of advisory objects for each dependency that matches the advisory range. Each advisory object contains a \fBname\fR, \fBurl\fR, \fBid\fR, \fBseverity\fR, \fBvulnerable_versions\fR, and \fBtitle\fR.
.P
npm then uses these advisory objects to calculate vulnerabilities and meta-vulnerabilities of the dependencies within the tree.
.SS "Quick Audit Endpoint"
.P
If the \fBBulk Advisory\fR endpoint returns an error, or invalid data, npm will attempt to load advisory data from the \fBQuick Audit\fR endpoint, which is considerably slower in most cases.
.P
The full package tree as found in \fBpackage-lock.json\fR is submitted, along with the following pieces of additional metadata:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
\fBnpm_version\fR
.IP \(bu 4
\fBnode_version\fR
.IP \(bu 4
\fBplatform\fR
.IP \(bu 4
\fBarch\fR
.IP \(bu 4
\fBnode_env\fR
.RE 0

.P
All packages in the tree are submitted to the Quick Audit endpoint. Omitted dependency types are skipped when generating the report.
.SS "Scrubbing"
.P
Out of an abundance of caution, npm versions 5 and 6 would "scrub" any packages from the submitted report if their name contained a \fB/\fR character, so as to avoid leaking the names of potentially private packages or git URLs.
.P
However, in practice, this resulted in audits often failing to properly detect meta-vulnerabilities, because the tree would appear to be invalid due to missing dependencies, and prevented the detection of vulnerabilities in package trees that used git dependencies or private modules.
.P
This scrubbing has been removed from npm as of version 7.
.SS "Calculating Meta-Vulnerabilities and Remediations"
.P
npm uses the \fB\fB@npmcli/metavuln-calculator\fR\fR \fI\(lahttp://npm.im/@npmcli/metavuln-calculator\(ra\fR module to turn a set of security advisories into a set of "vulnerability" objects. A "meta-vulnerability" is a dependency that is vulnerable by virtue of dependence on vulnerable versions of a vulnerable package.
.P
For example, if the package \fBfoo\fR is vulnerable in the range \fB>=1.0.2
<2.0.0\fR, and the package \fBbar\fR depends on \fBfoo@^1.1.0\fR, then that version of \fBbar\fR can only be installed by installing a vulnerable version of \fBfoo\fR. In this case, \fBbar\fR is a "metavulnerability".
.P
Once metavulnerabilities for a given package are calculated, they are cached in the \fB~/.npm\fR folder and only re-evaluated if the advisory range changes, or a new version of the package is published (in which case, the new version is checked for metavulnerable status as well).
.P
If the chain of metavulnerabilities extends all the way to the root project, and it cannot be updated without changing its dependency ranges, then \fBnpm audit fix\fR will require the \fB--force\fR option to apply the remediation. If remediations do not require changes to the dependency ranges, then all vulnerable packages will be updated to a version that does not have an advisory or metavulnerability posted against it.
.SS "Exit Code"
.P
The \fBnpm audit\fR command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities were found. The \fBnpm audit fix\fR command will exit with 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities are found \fIor\fR if the remediation is able to successfully fix all vulnerabilities.
.P
If vulnerabilities were found the exit code will depend on the \fB\fBaudit-level\fR config\fR \fI\(la/using-npm/config#audit-level\(ra\fR.
