.SS "Description"
.P
This is handy for installing your own stuff, so that you can work on it and test iteratively without having to continually rebuild.
.P
Package linking is a two-step process.
.P
First, \fBnpm link\fR in a package folder with no arguments will create a symlink in the global folder \fB{prefix}/lib/node_modules/<package>\fR that links to the package where the \fBnpm link\fR command was executed. It will also link any bins in the package to \fB{prefix}/bin/{name}\fR. Note that \fBnpm link\fR uses the global prefix (see \fBnpm prefix -g\fR for its value).
.P
Next, in some other location, \fBnpm link package-name\fR will create a symbolic link from globally-installed \fBpackage-name\fR to \fBnode_modules/\fR of the current folder.
.P
Note that \fBpackage-name\fR is taken from \fBpackage.json\fR, \fInot\fR from the directory name.
.P
The package name can be optionally prefixed with a scope. See npm help scope. The scope must be preceded by an @-symbol and followed by a slash.
.P
When creating tarballs for \fBnpm publish\fR, the linked packages are "snapshotted" to their current state by resolving the symbolic links, if they are included in \fBbundleDependencies\fR.
.P
For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
cd ~/projects/node-redis    # go into the package directory
npm link                    # creates global link
cd ~/projects/node-bloggy   # go into some other package directory.
npm link redis              # link-install the package
.fi
.RE
.P
Now, any changes to \fB~/projects/node-redis\fR will be reflected in \fB~/projects/node-bloggy/node_modules/node-redis/\fR. Note that the link should be to the package name, not the directory name for that package.
.P
You may also shortcut the two steps in one. For example, to do the above use-case in a shorter way:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
cd ~/projects/node-bloggy  # go into the dir of your main project
npm link ../node-redis     # link the dir of your dependency
.fi
.RE
.P
The second line is the equivalent of doing:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
(cd ../node-redis; npm link)
npm link redis
.fi
.RE
.P
That is, it first creates a global link, and then links the global installation target into your project's \fBnode_modules\fR folder.
.P
Note that in this case, you are referring to the directory name, \fBnode-redis\fR, rather than the package name \fBredis\fR.
.P
If your linked package is scoped (see npm help scope) your link command must include that scope, e.g.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm link @myorg/privatepackage
.fi
.RE
.SS "Caveat"
.P
Note that package dependencies linked in this way are \fInot\fR saved to \fBpackage.json\fR by default, on the assumption that the intention is to have a link stand in for a regular non-link dependency. Otherwise, for example, if you depend on \fBredis@^3.0.1\fR, and ran \fBnpm link redis\fR, it would replace the \fB^3.0.1\fR dependency with \fBfile:../path/to/node-redis\fR, which you probably don't want! Additionally, other users or developers on your project would run into issues if they do not have their folders set up exactly the same as yours.
.P
If you are adding a \fInew\fR dependency as a link, you should add it to the relevant metadata by running \fBnpm install <dep> --package-lock-only\fR.
.P
If you \fIwant\fR to save the \fBfile:\fR reference in your \fBpackage.json\fR and \fBpackage-lock.json\fR files, you can use \fBnpm link <dep> --save\fR to do so.
.SS "Workspace Usage"
.P
\fBnpm link <pkg> --workspace <name>\fR will link the relevant package as a dependency of the specified workspace(s). Note that It may actually be linked into the parent project's \fBnode_modules\fR folder, if there are no conflicting dependencies.
.P
\fBnpm link --workspace <name>\fR will create a global link to the specified workspace(s).

Save installed packages to a \fBpackage.json\fR file as dependencies.

When used with the \fBnpm rm\fR command, removes the dependency from \fBpackage.json\fR.

Type: "hoisted", "nested", "shallow", or "linked"
.RE 0

.P
Sets the strategy for installing packages in node_modules. hoisted (default): Install non-duplicated in top-level, and duplicated as necessary within directory structure. nested: (formerly --legacy-bundling) install in place, no hoisting. shallow (formerly --global-style) only install direct deps at top-level. linked: (experimental) install in node_modules/.store, link in place, unhoisted.

.RE 0

.P
Instead of hoisting package installs in \fBnode_modules\fR, install packages in the same manner that they are depended on. This may cause very deep directory structures and duplicate package installs as there is no de-duplicating. Sets \fB--install-strategy=nested\fR.

.SS "\fBstrict-peer-deps\fR"
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Default: false
.IP \(bu 4
Type: Boolean
.RE 0

.P
If set to \fBtrue\fR, and \fB--legacy-peer-deps\fR is not set, then \fIany\fR conflicting \fBpeerDependencies\fR will be treated as an install failure, even if npm could reasonably guess the appropriate resolution based on non-peer dependency relationships.
.P
By default, conflicting \fBpeerDependencies\fR deep in the dependency graph will be resolved using the nearest non-peer dependency specification, even if doing so will result in some packages receiving a peer dependency outside the range set in their package's \fBpeerDependencies\fR object.
.P
When such an override is performed, a warning is printed, explaining the conflict and the packages involved. If \fB--strict-peer-deps\fR is set, then this warning is treated as a failure.
.SS "\fBpackage-lock\fR"

.P
If set to false, then ignore \fBpackage-lock.json\fR files when installing. This will also prevent \fIwriting\fR \fBpackage-lock.json\fR if \fBsave\fR is true.

.RE 0

.P
Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk.
.P
Note that these dependencies \fIare\fR still resolved and added to the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR or \fBnpm-shrinkwrap.json\fR file. They are just not physically installed on disk.
.P
If a package type appears in both the \fB--include\fR and \fB--omit\fR lists, then it will be included.
.P
If the resulting omit list includes \fB'dev'\fR, then the \fBNODE_ENV\fR environment variable will be set to \fB'production'\fR for all lifecycle scripts.

.P
Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install.
.P
This is the inverse of \fB--omit=<type>\fR.
.P
Dependency types specified in \fB--include\fR will not be omitted, regardless of the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line.

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.
.P
Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as \fBnpm start\fR, \fBnpm stop\fR, \fBnpm restart\fR, \fBnpm test\fR, and \fBnpm run-script\fR will still run their intended script if \fBignore-scripts\fR is set, but they will \fInot\fR run any pre- or post-scripts.

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should only report what it would have done. This can be passed into any of the commands that modify your local installation, eg, \fBinstall\fR, \fBupdate\fR, \fBdedupe\fR, \fBuninstall\fR, as well as \fBpack\fR and \fBpublish\fR.

Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured workspaces.

Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fR to ignore workspaces altogether. When not set explicitly:

.IP \(bu 4
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fR tree (install, update, etc.) will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fR folder. - Commands that do other things (test, exec, publish, etc.) will operate on the root project, \fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fR config.
