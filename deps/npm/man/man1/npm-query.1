.SS "Expecting a certain number of results"
.P
One common use of \fBnpm query\fR is to make sure there is only one version of a certain dependency in your tree. This is especially common for ecosystems like that rely on \fBtypescript\fR where having state split across two different but identically-named packages causes bugs. You can use the \fB--expect-results\fR or \fB--expect-result-count\fR in your setup to ensure that npm will exit with an exit code if your tree doesn't look like you want it to.

$ npm query '#react' --expect-result-count=1

Perhaps you want to quickly check if there are any production dependencies that could be updated:

$ npm query ':root>:outdated(in-range).prod' --no-expect-results

.RE
.SS "Package lock only mode"
.P
If package-lock-only is enabled, only the information in the package lock (or shrinkwrap) is loaded. This means that information from the package.json files of your dependencies will not be included in the result set (e.g. description, homepage, engines).

Operates in "global" mode, so that packages are installed into the \fBprefix\fR folder instead of the current working directory. See npm help folders for more on the differences in behavior.

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by this configuration option.
.P
Valid values for the \fBworkspace\fR config are either:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Workspace names
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a workspace directory
.IP \(bu 4
Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all workspaces within that folder)
.RE 0

.P
When set for the \fBnpm init\fR command, this may be set to the folder of a workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a brand new workspace within the project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

.P
Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured workspaces.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fR to ignore workspaces altogether. When not set explicitly:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fR tree (install, update, etc.) will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fR folder. - Commands that do other things (test, exec, publish, etc.) will operate on the root project, \fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fR config.

.P
Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command.
.P
When false, specifying individual workspaces via the \fBworkspace\fR config, or all workspaces via the \fBworkspaces\fR flag, will cause npm to operate only on the specified workspaces, and not on the root project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

If set to true, the current operation will only use the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR, ignoring \fBnode_modules\fR.
.P
For \fBupdate\fR this means only the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR will be updated, instead of checking \fBnode_modules\fR and downloading dependencies.
.P
For \fBlist\fR this means the output will be based on the tree described by the \fBpackage-lock.json\fR, rather than the contents of \fBnode_modules\fR.
