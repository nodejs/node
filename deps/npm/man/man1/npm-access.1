.IP \(bu 4
ls-packages (deprecated): Show all of the packages a user or a team is able to access, along with the access level, except for read-only public packages (it won't print the whole registry listing)
.IP \(bu 4
ls-collaborators (deprecated): Show all of the access privileges for a package. Will only show permissions for packages to which you have at least read access. If \fB<user>\fR is passed in, the list is filtered only to teams \fIthat\fR user happens to belong to.

.SS "Details"
.P
\fBnpm access\fR always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from the command line using \fB--registry=<registry url>\fR.
.P
Unscoped packages are \fIalways public\fR.
.P
Scoped packages \fIdefault to restricted\fR, but you can either publish them as public using \fBnpm publish --access=public\fR, or set their access as public using \fBnpm access public\fR after the initial publish.
.P
You must have privileges to set the access of a package:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
You are an owner of an unscoped or scoped package.
.IP \(bu 4
You are a member of the team that owns a scope.
.IP \(bu 4
You have been given read-write privileges for a package, either as a member of a team or directly as an owner.
.RE 0

.P
If you have two-factor authentication enabled then you'll be prompted to provide a second factor, or may use the \fB--otp=...\fR option to specify it on the command line.
.P
If your account is not paid, then attempts to publish scoped packages will fail with an HTTP 402 status code (logically enough), unless you use \fB--access=public\fR.
.P
Management of teams and team memberships is done with the \fBnpm team\fR command.

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed when publishing or changing package permissions with \fBnpm access\fR.
