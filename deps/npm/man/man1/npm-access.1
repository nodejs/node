.SH DETAILS
.P
\fBnpm access\fP always operates directly on the current registry, configurable
from the command line using \fB\-\-registry=<registry url>\fP\|\.
.P
Unscoped packages are \fIalways public\fR\|\.
.P
Scoped packages \fIdefault to restricted\fR, but you can either publish them as
public using \fBnpm publish \-\-access=public\fP, or set their access as public using
\fBnpm access public\fP after the initial publish\.
.P
You must have privileges to set the access of a package:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
You are an owner of an unscoped or scoped package\.
.IP \(bu 2
You are a member of the team that owns a scope\.
.IP \(bu 2
You have been given read\-write privileges for a package, either as a member
of a team or directly as an owner\.

.RE
.P
If your account is not paid, then attempts to publish scoped packages will fail
with an HTTP 402 status code (logically enough), unless you use
\fB\-\-access=public\fP\|\.
.P
Management of teams and team memberships is done with the \fBnpm team\fP command\.
