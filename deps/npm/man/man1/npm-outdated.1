\fBnpm-outdated\fR \- Check for outdated packages
.SH SYNOPSIS

npm outdated [[<@scope>/]<pkg> \.\.\.]
.fi
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
This command will check the registry to see if any (or, specific) installed
packages are currently outdated\.
.P
In the output:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwanted\fP is the maximum version of the package that satisfies the semver
range specified in \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\. If there's no available semver range (i\.e\.
you're running \fBnpm outdated \-\-global\fP, or the package isn't included in
\fBpackage\.json\fP), then \fBwanted\fP shows the currently\-installed version\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlatest\fP is the version of the package tagged as latest in the registry\.
Running \fBnpm publish\fP with no special configuration will publish the package
with a dist\-tag of \fBlatest\fP\|\. This may or may not be the maximum version of
the package, or the most\-recently published version of the package, depending
on how the package's developer manages the latest npm help dist\-tag\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlocation\fP is where in the dependency tree the package is located\. Note that
\fBnpm outdated\fP defaults to a depth of 0, so unless you override that, you'll
always be seeing only top\-level dependencies that are outdated\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBpackage type\fP (when using \fB\-\-long\fP / \fB\-l\fP) tells you whether this package is
a \fBdependency\fP or a \fBdevDependency\fP\|\. Packages not included in \fBpackage\.json\fP
are always marked \fBdependencies\fP\|\.

With these \fBdependencies\fP:

.RS 2

  "glob": "^5\.0\.15",

  "npm": "^3\.5\.1",

}

A few things to note:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBglob\fP requires \fB^5\fP, which prevents npm from installing \fBglob@6\fP, which is
outside the semver range\.
.IP \(bu 2
Git dependencies will always be reinstalled, because of how they're specified\.
The installed committish might satisfy the dependency specifier (if it's
something immutable, like a commit SHA), or it might not, so \fBnpm outdated\fP and
\fBnpm update\fP have to fetch Git repos to check\. This is why currently doing a
reinstall of a Git dependency always forces a new clone and install\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBis marked as "wanted", but "latest" is\fP\fBbecause npm
uses dist\-tags to manage its\fPlatest\fBand\fPnext\fBrelease channels\.\fPnpm update\fBwill install the _newest_ version, but\fPnpm install npm\fB(with no semver range)
will install whatever's tagged as\fPlatest`\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBonce\fP is just plain out of date\. Reinstalling \fBnode_modules\fP from scratch or
running \fBnpm update\fP will bring it up to spec\.
