This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on\. If the
package has a package\-lock, or an npm shrinkwrap file, or a yarn lock file,
the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, respecting the
following order of precedence:

Even if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of benefits
of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and perhaps if
you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere after packing it up
into a tarball (b)\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install\fP (in a package directory, no arguments):
  Install the dependencies in the local \fBnode_modules\fP folder\.
  In global mode (ie, with \fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP appended to the command),
  it installs the current package context (ie, the current working
  directory) as a global package\.
  By default, \fBnpm install\fP will install all modules listed as
  dependencies in npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\.
  With the \fB\-\-production\fP flag (or when the \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment
  variable is set to \fBproduction\fP), npm will not install modules listed
  in \fBdevDependencies\fP\|\. To install all modules listed in both
  \fBdependencies\fP and \fBdevDependencies\fP when \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment
  variable is set to \fBproduction\fP, you can use \fB\-\-production=false\fP\|\.
.QP
NOTE: The \fB\-\-production\fP flag has no particular meaning when adding a
  dependency to a project\.

.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <folder>\fP:
  Install the package in the directory as a symlink in the current
  project\.  Its dependencies will be installed before it's linked\. If
  \fB<folder>\fP sits inside the root of your project, its dependencies may
  be hoisted to the top\-level \fBnode_modules\fP as they would for other
  types of dependencies\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <tarball file>\fP:
  Install a package that is sitting on the filesystem\.  Note: if you just
  want to link a dev directory into your npm root, you can do this more
  easily by using npm help \fBlink\fP\|\.
  Tarball requirements:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
The filename \fImust\fR use \fB\|\.tar\fP, \fB\|\.tar\.gz\fP, or \fB\|\.tgz\fP as the
extension\.
.IP \(bu 2
The package contents should reside in a subfolder inside the tarball
(usually it is called \fBpackage/\fP)\. npm strips one directory layer
when installing the package (an equivalent of \fBtar x
\-\-strip\-components=1\fP is run)\.
.IP \(bu 2
The package must contain a \fBpackage\.json\fP file with \fBname\fP and
\fBversion\fP properties\.
Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm install \./package\.tgz
.fi
.RE

.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <tarball url>\fP:
  Fetch the tarball url, and then install it\.  In order to distinguish between
  this and other options, the argument must start with "http://" or "https://"
  Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
  npm install https://github\.com/indexzero/forever/tarball/v0\.5\.6
.fi
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>\fP:
  Do a \fB<name>@<tag>\fP install, where \fB<tag>\fP is the "tag" config\. (See
  npm help \fBconfig\fP\|\. The config's default value is \fBlatest\fP\|\.)
  In most cases, this will install the version of the modules tagged as
  \fBlatest\fP on the npm registry\.
  Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
  npm install sax
.fi
.RE
  \fBnpm install\fP saves any specified packages into \fBdependencies\fP by default\.
  Additionally, you can control where and how they get saved with some
  additional flags:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-P, \-\-save\-prod\fP: Package will appear in your \fBdependencies\fP\|\. This
is the default unless \fB\-D\fP or \fB\-O\fP are present\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-D, \-\-save\-dev\fP: Package will appear in your \fBdevDependencies\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-O, \-\-save\-optional\fP: Package will appear in your
\fBoptionalDependencies\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-no\-save\fP: Prevents saving to \fBdependencies\fP\|\.
When using any of the above options to save dependencies to your
package\.json, there are two additional, optional flags:
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-E, \-\-save\-exact\fP: Saved dependencies will be configured with an
exact version rather than using npm's default semver range operator\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-B, \-\-save\-bundle\fP: Saved dependencies will also be added to your
\fBbundleDependencies\fP list\.
Further, if you have an \fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP or \fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP
then it will be updated as well\.
\fB<scope>\fP is optional\. The package will be downloaded from the registry
associated with the specified scope\. If no registry is associated with
the given scope the default registry is assumed\. See
npm help \fBscope\fP\|\.
Note: if you do not include the @\-symbol on your scope name, npm will
interpret this as a GitHub repository instead, see below\. Scopes names
must also be followed by a slash\.
Examples:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm install sax
npm install githubname/reponame
npm install @myorg/privatepackage
npm install node\-tap \-\-save\-dev
npm install dtrace\-provider \-\-save\-optional
npm install readable\-stream \-\-save\-exact
npm install ansi\-regex \-\-save\-bundle
.fi
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fINote*\fR: If there is a file or folder named \fB<name>\fP in the current
working directory, then it will try to install that, and only try to
fetch the package by name if it is not valid\.

.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <alias>@npm:<name>\fP:
  Install a package under a custom alias\. Allows multiple versions of
  a same\-name package side\-by\-side, more convenient import names for
  packages with otherwise long ones, and using git forks replacements
  or forked npm packages as replacements\. Aliasing works only on your
  project and does not rename packages in transitive dependencies\.
  Aliases should follow the naming conventions stated in
  \fBvalidate\-npm\-package\-name\fP \fIhttps://www\.npmjs\.com/package/validate\-npm\-package\-name#naming\-rules\fR\|\.
  Examples:
.P
.RS 2

.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<tag>\fP:
  Install the version of the package that is referenced by the specified tag\.
  If the tag does not exist in the registry data for that package, then this
  will fail\.
  Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
  npm install sax@latest
  npm install @myorg/mypackage@latest
.fi
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version>\fP:
  Install the specified version of the package\.  This will fail if the
  version has not been published to the registry\.
  Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
  npm install sax@0\.1\.1
  npm install @myorg/privatepackage@1\.5\.0
.fi
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version range>\fP:
  Install a version of the package matching the specified version range\.
  This will follow the same rules for resolving dependencies described in
  npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\.
  Note that most version ranges must be put in quotes so that your shell
  will treat it as a single argument\.
  Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
  npm install sax@">=0\.1\.0 <0\.2\.0"
  npm install @myorg/privatepackage@"16 \- 17"
.fi
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <git remote url>\fP:
  Installs the package from the hosted git provider, cloning it with
  \fBgit\fP\|\.  For a full git remote url, only that URL will be attempted\.
.P
.RS 2
.nf
  <protocol>://[<user>[:<password>]@]<hostname>[:<port>][:][/]<path>[#<commit\-ish> | #semver:<semver>]
.fi
.RE
  \fB<protocol>\fP is one of \fBgit\fP, \fBgit+ssh\fP, \fBgit+http\fP, \fBgit+https\fP, or
  \fBgit+file\fP\|\.
  If \fB#<commit\-ish>\fP is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
  commit\. If the commit\-ish has the format \fB#semver:<semver>\fP, \fB<semver>\fP
  can be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for
  any tags or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as
  it would for a registry dependency\. If neither \fB#<commit\-ish>\fP or
  \fB#semver:<semver>\fP is specified, then the default branch of the
  repository is used\.
  If the repository makes use of submodules, those submodules will be
  cloned as well\.
  If the package being installed contains a \fBprepare\fP script, its
  \fBdependencies\fP and \fBdevDependencies\fP will be installed, and the prepare
  script will be run, before the package is packaged and installed\.
  The following git environment variables are recognized by npm and will
  be added to the environment when running git:
