.SS Description
.P
This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on\. If the
package has a package\-lock or shrinkwrap file, the installation of dependencies
will be driven by that, with an \fBnpm\-shrinkwrap\.json\fP taking precedence if both
files exist\. See npm help package\-lock\.json and npm help \fBshrinkwrap\fP\|\.
.P
A \fBpackage\fP is:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
a) a folder containing a program described by a npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP file
.IP \(bu 2
b) a gzipped tarball containing (a)
.IP \(bu 2
c) a url that resolves to (b)
.IP \(bu 2
d) a \fB<name>@<version>\fP that is published on the registry (see npm help \fBregistry\fP) with (c)

Even if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of
benefits of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and
perhaps if you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere
after packing it up into a tarball (b)\.

\fBnpm install\fP (in package directory, no arguments):
  Install the dependencies in the local node_modules folder\.
  In global mode (ie, with \fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP appended to the command),
  it installs the current package context (ie, the current working
  directory) as a global package\.
  By default, \fBnpm install\fP will install all modules listed as dependencies
  in npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\.
  With the \fB\-\-production\fP flag (or when the \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment variable
  is set to \fBproduction\fP), npm will not install modules listed in
  \fBdevDependencies\fP\|\. To install all modules listed in both \fBdependencies\fP 
  and \fBdevDependencies\fP when \fBNODE_ENV\fP environment variable is set to \fBproduction\fP, 
  you can use \fB\-\-production=false\fP\|\.
.QP
NOTE: The \fB\-\-production\fP flag has no particular meaning when adding a
  dependency to a project\.

.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <folder>\fP:
  Install the package in the directory as a symlink in the current project\.
  Its dependencies will be installed before it's linked\. If \fB<folder>\fP sits
  inside the root of your project, its dependencies may be hoisted to the
  toplevel \fBnode_modules\fP as they would for other types of dependencies\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <tarball file>\fP:
  Install a package that is sitting on the filesystem\.  Note: if you just want
  to link a dev directory into your npm root, you can do this more easily by
  using \fBnpm link\fP\|\.
  Tarball requirements:
.RS
.IP \(bu 2
The filename \fImust\fR use \fB\|\.tar\fP, \fB\|\.tar\.gz\fP, or \fB\|\.tgz\fP as
the extension\.
.IP \(bu 2
The package contents should reside in a subfolder inside the tarball (usually it is called \fBpackage/\fP)\. npm strips one directory layer when installing the package (an equivalent of \fBtar x \-\-strip\-components=1\fP is run)\.
.IP \(bu 2
The package must contain a \fBpackage\.json\fP file with \fBname\fP and \fBversion\fP properties\.
Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
npm install \./package\.tgz
.fi
.RE

.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <tarball url>\fP:
  Fetch the tarball url, and then install it\.  In order to distinguish between
  this and other options, the argument must start with "http://" or "https://"
  Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
    npm install https://github\.com/indexzero/forever/tarball/v0\.5\.6
.fi
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>\fP:
  Do a \fB<name>@<tag>\fP install, where \fB<tag>\fP is the "tag" config\. (See
  npm help \fBconfig\fP\|\. The config's default value is \fBlatest\fP\|\.)
  In most cases, this will install the version of the modules tagged as
  \fBlatest\fP on the npm registry\.
  Example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
    npm install sax
.fi
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install <alias>@npm:<name>\fP:
  Install a package under a custom alias\. Allows multiple versions of
  a same\-name package side\-by\-side, more convenient import names for
  packages with otherwise long ones and using git forks replacements
  or forked npm packages as replacements\. Aliasing works only on your
  project and does not rename packages in transitive dependencies\.
  Aliases should follow the naming conventions stated in
  \fBvalidate\-npm\-package\-name\fP \fIhttps://www\.npmjs\.com/package/validate\-npm\-package\-name#naming\-rules\fR\|\.
  Examples:
.P
.RS 2
.nf

`npm install` saves any specified packages into `dependencies` by default\.
Additionally, you can control where and how they get saved with some
additional flags:

* `\-P, \-\-save\-prod`: Package will appear in your `dependencies`\. This is the
                     default unless `\-D` or `\-O` are present\.

* `\-D, \-\-save\-dev`: Package will appear in your `devDependencies`\.

* `\-O, \-\-save\-optional`: Package will appear in your `optionalDependencies`\.

* `\-\-no\-save`: Prevents saving to `dependencies`\.

When using any of the above options to save dependencies to your
package\.json, there are two additional, optional flags:

* `\-E, \-\-save\-exact`: Saved dependencies will be configured with an
  exact version rather than using npm's default semver range
  operator\.

* `\-B, \-\-save\-bundle`: Saved dependencies will also be added to your `bundleDependencies` list\.

Further, if you have an `npm\-shrinkwrap\.json` or `package\-lock\.json` then it
will be updated as well\.

`<scope>` is optional\. The package will be downloaded from the registry
associated with the specified scope\. If no registry is associated with
the given scope the default registry is assumed\. See npm help `scope`\.

Note: if you do not include the @\-symbol on your scope name, npm will
interpret this as a GitHub repository instead, see below\. Scopes names
must also be followed by a slash\.

Examples:

```bash
npm install sax
npm install githubname/reponame
npm install @myorg/privatepackage
npm install node\-tap \-\-save\-dev
npm install dtrace\-provider \-\-save\-optional
npm install readable\-stream \-\-save\-exact
npm install ansi\-regex \-\-save\-bundle
```

**Note**: If there is a file or folder named `<name>` in the current
working directory, then it will try to install that, and only try to
fetch the package by name if it is not valid\.

\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<tag>\fP:

.RS 2
.nf
  npm install sax@latest

.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version>\fP:

  npm install sax@0\.1\.1
  npm install @myorg/privatepackage@1\.5\.0

\fBnpm install [<@scope>/]<name>@<version range>\fP:
  Install a version of the package matching the specified version range\.  This
  will follow the same rules for resolving dependencies described in npm help \fBpackage\.json\fP\|\.
  Note that most version ranges must be put in quotes so that your shell will
  treat it as a single argument\.
  Example:
.P

  npm install sax@">=0\.1\.0 <0\.2\.0"
  npm install @myorg/privatepackage@">=0\.1\.0 <0\.2\.0"

    <protocol>://[<user>[:<password>]@]<hostname>[:<port>][:][/]<path>[#<commit\-ish> | #semver:<semver>]
.fi
.RE
  \fB<protocol>\fP is one of \fBgit\fP, \fBgit+ssh\fP, \fBgit+http\fP, \fBgit+https\fP, or
  \fBgit+file\fP\|\.
  If \fB#<commit\-ish>\fP is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
  commit\. If the commit\-ish has the format \fB#semver:<semver>\fP, \fB<semver>\fP can
  be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for any tags
  or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as it would for a
  registry dependency\. If neither \fB#<commit\-ish>\fP or \fB#semver:<semver>\fP is
  specified, then the default branch of the repository is used\.
  If the repository makes use of submodules, those submodules will be cloned
  as well\.
  If the package being installed contains a \fBprepare\fP script, its
  \fBdependencies\fP and \fBdevDependencies\fP will be installed, and the prepare
  script will be run, before the package is packaged and installed\.
  The following git environment variables are recognized by npm and will be
  added to the environment when running git:

.P
The \fB\-g\fP or \fB\-\-global\fP argument will cause npm to install the package globally
rather than locally\.  See npm help folders\.
.P
The \fB\-\-global\-style\fP argument will cause npm to install the package into
your local \fBnode_modules\fP folder with the same layout it uses with the
global \fBnode_modules\fP folder\. Only your direct dependencies will show in
\fBnode_modules\fP and everything they depend on will be flattened in their
\fBnode_modules\fP folders\. This obviously will eliminate some deduping\.
.P
The \fB\-\-ignore\-scripts\fP argument will cause npm to not execute any
scripts defined in the package\.json\. See npm help \fBscripts\fP\|\.
.P
The \fB\-\-legacy\-bundling\fP argument will cause npm to install the package such
that versions of npm prior to 1\.4, such as the one included with node 0\.8,
can install the package\. This eliminates all automatic deduping\.
.P
The \fB\-\-link\fP argument will cause npm to link global installs into the

The \fB\-\-no\-bin\-links\fP argument will prevent npm from creating symlinks for
any binaries the package might contain\.

The \fB\-\-no\-shrinkwrap\fP argument, which will ignore an available
package lock or shrinkwrap file and use the package\.json instead\.
.P
The \fB\-\-no\-package\-lock\fP argument will prevent npm from creating a
\fBpackage\-lock\.json\fP file\.  When running with package\-lock's disabled npm
will not automatically prune your node modules when installing\.
.P
The \fB\-\-nodedir=/path/to/node/source\fP argument will allow npm to find the
node source code so that npm can compile native modules\.
.P
The \fB\-\-only={prod[uction]|dev[elopment]}\fP argument will cause either only
\fBdevDependencies\fP or only non\-\fBdevDependencies\fP to be installed regardless of the \fBNODE_ENV\fP\|\.
.P
The \fB\-\-no\-audit\fP argument can be used to disable sending of audit reports to
the configured registries\.  See \fBnpm\-audit\fP \fInpm\-audit\fR for details on what is sent\.

.SS Algorithm
.P
To install a package, npm uses the following algorithm:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
load the existing node_modules tree from disk
clone the tree
fetch the package\.json and assorted metadata and add it to the clone
walk the clone and add any missing dependencies
  dependencies will be added as close to the top as is possible
  without breaking any other modules
compare the original tree with the cloned tree and make a list of
actions to take to convert one to the other
execute all of the actions, deepest first
  kinds of actions are install, update, remove and move
.fi
.RE
.P
For this \fBpackage{dep}\fP structure: \fBA{B,C}, B{C}, C{D}\fP,
this algorithm produces:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
A
+\-\- B
+\-\- C
+\-\- D
.fi
.RE
.P
That is, the dependency from B to C is satisfied by the fact that A
already caused C to be installed at a higher level\. D is still installed
at the top level because nothing conflicts with it\.
.P
For \fBA{B,C}, B{C,D@1}, C{D@2}\fP, this algorithm produces:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
A
+\-\- B
+\-\- C
   `\-\- D@2
+\-\- D@1
.fi
.RE
.P
Because B's D@1 will be installed in the top level, C now has to install D@2
privately for itself\. This algorithm is deterministic, but different trees may
be produced if two dependencies are requested for installation in a different
order\.
.P
See npm help folders for a more detailed description of the specific folder structures that npm creates\.
.SS Limitations of npm's Install Algorithm
.P
npm will refuse to install any package with an identical name to the
current package\. This can be overridden with the \fB\-\-force\fP flag, but in
most cases can simply be addressed by changing the local package name\.
.P
There are some very rare and pathological edge\-cases where a cycle can
cause npm to try to install a never\-ending tree of packages\.  Here is
the simplest case:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
A \-> B \-> A' \-> B' \-> A \-> B \-> A' \-> B' \-> A \-> \.\.\.
.fi
.RE
.P
where \fBA\fP is some version of a package, and \fBA'\fP is a different version
of the same package\.  Because \fBB\fP depends on a different version of \fBA\fP
than the one that is already in the tree, it must install a separate
copy\.  The same is true of \fBA'\fP, which must install \fBB'\fP\|\.  Because \fBB'\fP
depends on the original version of \fBA\fP, which has been overridden, the
cycle falls into infinite regress\.
.P
To avoid this situation, npm flat\-out refuses to install any
\fBname@version\fP that is already present anywhere in the tree of package
folder ancestors\.  A more correct, but more complex, solution would be
to symlink the existing version into the new location\.  If this ever
affects a real use\-case, it will be investigated\.
