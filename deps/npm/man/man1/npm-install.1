.SS "Description"
.P
This command installs a package and any packages that it depends on. If the package has a package-lock, or an npm shrinkwrap file, or a yarn lock file, the installation of dependencies will be driven by that, respecting the following order of precedence:

a) a folder containing a program described by a \fB\fBpackage.json\fR\fR \fI\(la/configuring-npm/package-json\(ra\fR file

.RE 0

.P
Even if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of benefits of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and perhaps if you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere after packing it up into a tarball (b).
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 4
\fBnpm install\fR (in a package directory, no arguments):
.P
Install the dependencies to the local \fBnode_modules\fR folder.
.P
In global mode (ie, with \fB-g\fR or \fB--global\fR appended to the command), it installs the current package context (ie, the current working directory) as a global package.
.P
By default, \fBnpm install\fR will install all modules listed as dependencies in \fB\fBpackage.json\fR\fR \fI\(la/configuring-npm/package-json\(ra\fR.
.P
With the \fB--production\fR flag (or when the \fBNODE_ENV\fR environment variable is set to \fBproduction\fR), npm will not install modules listed in \fBdevDependencies\fR. To install all modules listed in both \fBdependencies\fR and \fBdevDependencies\fR when \fBNODE_ENV\fR environment variable is set to \fBproduction\fR, you can use \fB--production=false\fR.
.RS 4
.P
NOTE: The \fB--production\fR flag has no particular meaning when adding a dependency to a project.

.IP \(bu 4
\fBnpm install <folder>\fR:
.P
If \fB<folder>\fR sits inside the root of your project, its dependencies will be installed and may be hoisted to the top-level \fBnode_modules\fR as they would for other types of dependencies. If \fB<folder>\fR sits outside the root of your project, \fInpm will not install the package dependencies\fR in the directory \fB<folder>\fR, but it will create a symlink to \fB<folder>\fR.
.RS 4
.P
NOTE: If you want to install the content of a directory like a package from the registry instead of creating a link, you would need to use the \fB--install-links\fR option.

\fBnpm install <tarball file>\fR:

Install a package that is sitting on the filesystem. Note: if you just want to link a dev directory into your npm root, you can do this more easily by using npm help link.

Tarball requirements:
.RS 4
.IP \(bu 4
The filename \fImust\fR use \fB.tar\fR, \fB.tar.gz\fR, or \fB.tgz\fR as the extension.
.IP \(bu 4
The package contents should reside in a subfolder inside the tarball (usually it is called \fBpackage/\fR). npm strips one directory layer when installing the package (an equivalent of \fBtar x
--strip-components=1\fR is run).
.IP \(bu 4
The package must contain a \fBpackage.json\fR file with \fBname\fR and \fBversion\fR properties.

.RS 2

.IP \(bu 4
\fBnpm install <tarball url>\fR:

Fetch the tarball url, and then install it. In order to distinguish between this and other options, the argument must start with "http://" or "https://"

\fBnpm install \[lB]<@scope>/\[rB]<name>\fR:

Do a \fB<name>@<tag>\fR install, where \fB<tag>\fR is the "tag" config. (See \fB\fBconfig\fR\fR \fI\(la/using-npm/config#tag\(ra\fR. The config's default value is \fBlatest\fR.)

\fBnpm install\fR saves any specified packages into \fBdependencies\fR by default. Additionally, you can control where and how they get saved with some additional flags:
.RS 4
.IP \(bu 4
\fB-P, --save-prod\fR: Package will appear in your \fBdependencies\fR. This is the default unless \fB-D\fR or \fB-O\fR are present.
.IP \(bu 4

.IP \(bu 4
\fB--save-peer\fR: Package will appear in your \fBpeerDependencies\fR.

\fB-O, --save-optional\fR: Package will appear in your \fBoptionalDependencies\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB--no-save\fR: Prevents saving to \fBdependencies\fR.
.RE 0

.P
When using any of the above options to save dependencies to your package.json, there are two additional, optional flags:
.RS 4
.IP \(bu 4
\fB-E, --save-exact\fR: Saved dependencies will be configured with an exact version rather than using npm's default semver range operator.
.IP \(bu 4
\fB-B, --save-bundle\fR: Saved dependencies will also be added to your \fBbundleDependencies\fR list.
.RE 0

.P
Further, if you have an \fBnpm-shrinkwrap.json\fR or \fBpackage-lock.json\fR then it will be updated as well.
.P
\fB<scope>\fR is optional. The package will be downloaded from the registry associated with the specified scope. If no registry is associated with the given scope the default registry is assumed. See npm help scope.
.P
Note: if you do not include the @-symbol on your scope name, npm will interpret this as a GitHub repository instead, see below. Scopes names must also be followed by a slash.
.P
Examples:

.RS 2

npm install sax

.RE
.IP \(bu 4
\fBnpm install <alias>@npm:<name>\fR:
.P
Install a package under a custom alias. Allows multiple versions of a same-name package side-by-side, more convenient import names for packages with otherwise long ones, and using git forks replacements or forked npm packages as replacements. Aliasing works only on your project and does not rename packages in transitive dependencies. Aliases should follow the naming conventions stated in \fB\fBvalidate-npm-package-name\fR\fR \fI\(lahttps://www.npmjs.com/package/validate-npm-package-name#naming-rules\(ra\fR.

\fBnpm install \[lB]<@scope>/\[rB]<name>@<tag>\fR:

.IP \(bu 4
\fBnpm install \[lB]<@scope>/\[rB]<name>@<version>\fR:

.IP \(bu 4
\fBnpm install \[lB]<@scope>/\[rB]<name>@<version range>\fR:

Install a version of the package matching the specified version range. This will follow the same rules for resolving dependencies described in \fB\fBpackage.json\fR\fR \fI\(la/configuring-npm/package-json\(ra\fR.
.P
Note that most version ranges must be put in quotes so that your shell will treat it as a single argument.

When set for the \fBnpm init\fR command, this may be set to the folder of a workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a brand new workspace within the project.

Set to true to run the command in the context of \fBall\fR configured workspaces.
.P
Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like \fBinstall\fR to ignore workspaces altogether. When not set explicitly:

.IP \(bu 4
Commands that operate on the \fBnode_modules\fR tree (install, update, etc.) will link workspaces into the \fBnode_modules\fR folder. - Commands that do other things (test, exec, publish, etc.) will operate on the root project, \fIunless\fR one or more workspaces are specified in the \fBworkspace\fR config.

.P
Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command.
.P
When false, specifying individual workspaces via the \fBworkspace\fR config, or all workspaces via the \fBworkspaces\fR flag, will cause npm to operate only on the specified workspaces, and not on the root project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

.P
When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular dependencies instead of creating a symlink. This option has no effect on workspaces.
.SS "Algorithm"
.P
Given a \fBpackage{dep}\fR structure: \fBA{B,C}, B{C}, C{D}\fR, the npm install algorithm produces:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
A
+-- B
+-- C
+-- D
.fi
.RE
.P
That is, the dependency from B to C is satisfied by the fact that A already caused C to be installed at a higher level. D is still installed at the top level because nothing conflicts with it.
.P
For \fBA{B,C}, B{C,D@1}, C{D@2}\fR, this algorithm produces:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
A
+-- B
+-- C
   `-- D@2
+-- D@1
.fi
.RE
.P
Because B's D@1 will be installed in the top-level, C now has to install D@2 privately for itself. This algorithm is deterministic, but different trees may be produced if two dependencies are requested for installation in a different order.
.P
