.SH "NAME"
\fBnpmrc\fR \- The npm config files
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
npm gets its config settings from the command line, environment
variables, and \fB\fP files\.
.P
The \fB\fP command can be used to update and edit the contents
of the user and global npmrc files\.
.P
For a list of available configuration options, see npm help 7 config\.
.SH FILES
.P
The four relevant files are:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
per\-project config file (/path/to/my/project/\.npmrc)
.IP \(bu 2
per\-user config file (~/\.npmrc)
.IP \(bu 2
global config file ($PREFIX/etc/npmrc)
.IP \(bu 2
npm builtin config file (/path/to/npm/npmrc)

.RE
.P
All npm config files are an ini\-formatted list of \fB\fP
parameters\.  Environment variables can be replaced using
\fB\fP\|\. For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
prefix = ${HOME}/\.npm\-packages
.fi
.RE
.P
Each of these files is loaded, and config options are resolved in
priority order\.  For example, a setting in the userconfig file would
override the setting in the globalconfig file\.
.P
Array values are specified by adding "[]" after the key name\. For
example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf
key[] = "first value"
key[] = "second value"
.fi
.RE
.SS Comments
.P
Lines in \fB\fP files are interpreted as comments when they begin with a \fB\fP or \fB\fP character\. \fB\fP files are parsed by npm/ini \fIhttps://github\.com/npm/ini\fR, which specifies this comment syntax\.
.P
For example:
.P
.RS 2
.nf

@myscope:registry=https://mycustomregistry\.example\.org

.RE
.SS Per\-project config file
.P
When working locally in a project, a \fB\fP file in the root of the
project (ie, a sibling of \fB\fP and \fB\fP) will set
config values specific to this project\.
.P
Note that this only applies to the root of the project that you're
running npm in\.  It has no effect when your module is published\.  For
example, you can't publish a module that forces itself to install
globally, or in a different location\.
.P
Additionally, this file is not read in global mode, such as when running
\fB\fP\|\.
.SS Per\-user config file
.P
\fB\fP (or the \fB\fP param, if set in the environment
or on the command line)
.SS Global config file
.P
\fB\fP (or the \fB\fP param, if set above):
This file is an ini\-file formatted list of \fB\fP parameters\.
Environment variables can be replaced as above\.
.SS Built\-in config file
.P
\fB\fP
.P
This is an unchangeable "builtin" configuration file that npm keeps
consistent across updates\.  Set fields in here using the \fB\fP
script that comes with npm\.  This is primarily for distribution
maintainers to override default configs in a standard and consistent
manner\.
