\fBinstall\fR - Download and install node and npm
.SS "Description"
.P
To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry, you must install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer. \fBWe strongly recommend using a Node version manager to install Node.js and npm.\fR We do not recommend using a Node installer, since the Node installation process installs npm in a directory with local permissions and can cause permissions errors when you run npm packages globally.

.P
Node version managers allow you to install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm on your system so you can test your applications on multiple versions of npm to ensure they work for users on different versions. You can \fBsearch for them on GitHub\fR \fI\(lahttps://github.com/search?q=node+version+manager+archived%3Afalse&type=repositories&ref=advsearch\(ra\fR.

If you are unable to use a Node version manager, you can use a Node installer to install both Node.js and npm on your system.
