* Finished
  * [COMPLETED] npm: remove packageIntegrity
  * [COMPLETED] npm: fix lifecycle stuff
    * pack:
      * pre-: immediately before tarball contents are packed. Need to re-read package.json immediately after
      * pack: No pack lifecycle
      * post-: immediately after tarball reaches its final destination (not immediately after packaging)
    * prepare: `npm install`, immediately before `postinstall`, and immediately before `prepack`, never if `--prod`, after prepublish, before prepublishOnly
    * prepublish: alias for `prepare`
    * prepublishOnly: ONLY on `npm publish` (never on `npm pack`), runs before prepack (which takes care of re-reading package.json), re-reads package.json immediately after
