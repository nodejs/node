### Requirements

One of the following versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run **`npm`**:

### Installation

**`npm`** comes bundled with [**`node`**](https://nodejs.org/), & most third-party distributions, by default. Officially supported downloads/distributions can be found at: [nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

#### Direct Download

You can download & install **`npm`** directly from [**npmjs**.com](https://npmjs.com/) using our custom `install.sh` script:

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```

#### Node Version Managers

If you're looking to manage multiple versions of **`node`** &/or **`npm`**, consider using a "Node Version Manager" such as:

* [**`nvm`**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
* [**`nvs`**](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs)
* [**`nave`**](https://github.com/isaacs/nave)
* [**`n`**](https://github.com/tj/n)
* [**`volta`**](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta)
* [**`nodenv`**](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)
* [**`asdf-nodejs`**](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs)
* [**`nvm-windows`**](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
* [**`fnm`**](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

### Usage

* You can configure `npm` to use any other compatible registry you prefer. You can read more about configuring third-party registries [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/registry)

### FAQ on Branding

#### Is it "npm" or "NPM" or "Npm"?

**`npm`** should never be capitalized unless it is being displayed in a location that is customarily all-capitals (ex. titles on `man` pages).

#### Is "npm" an acronym for "Node Package Manager"?

Contrary to popular belief, **`npm`** **is not** in fact an acronym for "Node Package Manager"; It is a recursive bacronymic abbreviation for **"npm is not an acronym"** (if the project was named "ninaa", then it would be an acronym). The precursor to **`npm`** was actually a bash utility named **"pm"**, which was the shortform name of **"pkgmakeinst"** - a bash function that installed various things on various platforms. If **`npm`** were to ever have been considered an acronym, it would be as "node pm" or, potentially "new pm".
