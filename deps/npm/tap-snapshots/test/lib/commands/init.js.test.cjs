This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See \`npm help init\` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use \`npm install <pkg>\` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
