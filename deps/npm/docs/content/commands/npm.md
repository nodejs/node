### Synopsis

```bash
npm
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Version

11.1.0

### Description

npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform.  It puts
modules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency
conflicts intelligently.

It is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases.  Most
commonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node
programs.

Run `npm help` to get a list of available commands.

### Important

npm comes preconfigured to use npm's public registry at
https://registry.npmjs.org by default. Use of the npm public registry is
subject to terms of use available at
https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/terms.

You can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even
run your own registry. Use of someone else's registry is governed by
their terms of use.

### Introduction

You probably got npm because you want to install stuff.

The very first thing you will most likely want to run in any node
program is `npm install` to install its dependencies.

You can also run `npm install blerg` to install the latest version of
"blerg".  Check out [`npm install`](/commands/npm-install) for more
info.  It can do a lot of stuff.

Use the `npm search` command to show everything that's available in the
public registry.  Use `npm ls` to show everything you've installed.

### Dependencies

If a package lists a dependency using a git URL, npm will install that
dependency using the [`git`](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
command and will generate an error if it is not installed.

If one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and
requires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use
[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) for that task.
For a Unix system, [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)
needs Python, make and a buildchain like GCC. On Windows,
Python and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ are needed. For more information
visit [the node-gyp repository](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) and
the [node-gyp Wiki](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/wiki).

### Directories

See [`folders`](/configuring-npm/folders) to learn about where npm puts
stuff.

In particular, npm has two modes of operation:

* local mode:
  npm installs packages into the current project directory, which
  defaults to the current working directory.  Packages install to
  `./node_modules`, and bins to `./node_modules/.bin`.
* global mode:
  npm installs packages into the install prefix at
  `$npm_config_prefix/lib/node_modules` and bins to
  `$npm_config_prefix/bin`.

Local mode is the default.  Use `-g` or `--global` on any command to
run in global mode instead.

### Developer Usage

If you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the
following help topics:

* json:
  Make a package.json file.  See
  [`package.json`](/configuring-npm/package-json).
* link:
  Links your current working code into Node's path, so that you don't
  have to reinstall every time you make a change.  Use [`npm
  link`](/commands/npm-link) to do this.
* install:
  It's a good idea to install things if you don't need the symbolic
  link.  Especially, installing other peoples code from the registry is
  done via [`npm install`](/commands/npm-install)
* adduser:
  Create an account or log in.  When you do this, npm will store
  credentials in the user config file.
* publish:
  Use the [`npm publish`](/commands/npm-publish) command to upload your
  code to the registry.

#### Configuration

npm is extremely configurable.  It reads its configuration options from
5 places.

* Command line switches:
  Set a config with `--key val`.  All keys take a value, even if they
  are booleans (the config parser doesn't know what the options are at
  the time of parsing).  If you do not provide a value (`--key`) then
  the option is set to boolean `true`.
* Environment Variables:
  Set any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with
  `npm_config_`.  For example, `export npm_config_key=val`.
* User Configs:
  The file at `$HOME/.npmrc` is an ini-formatted list of configs.  If
  present, it is parsed.  If the `userconfig` option is set in the cli
  or env, that file will be used instead.
* Global Configs:
  The file found at `./etc/npmrc` (relative to the global prefix will be
  parsed if it is found.  See [`npm prefix`](/commands/npm-prefix) for
  more info on the global prefix.  If the `globalconfig` option is set
  in the cli, env, or user config, then that file is parsed instead.
* Defaults:
  npm's default configuration options are defined in
  `lib/utils/config/definitions.js`.  These must not be changed.

See [`config`](/using-npm/config) for much much more information.
