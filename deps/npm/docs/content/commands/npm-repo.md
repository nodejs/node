### Synopsis

```bash
npm repo [<pkgname> [<pkgname> ...]]
```

### Description

This command tries to guess at the likely location of a package's
repository URL, and then tries to open it using the `--browser` config
param. If no package name is provided, it will search for a `package.json`
in the current folder and use the `repository` property.

#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option.

Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result to selecting all of the
  nested workspaces)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.
