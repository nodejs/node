title: npm-adduser
section: 1
description: Add a registry user account
---

### Synopsis

```bash
npm adduser [--registry=url] [--scope=@orgname] [--auth-type=legacy]

aliases: login, add-user
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Create or verify a user named `<username>` in the specified registry, and
save the credentials to the `.npmrc` file. If no registry is specified,
the default registry will be used (see [`config`](/using-npm/config)).

The username, password, and email are read in from prompts.

To reset your password, go to <https://www.npmjs.com/forgot>

To change your email address, go to <https://www.npmjs.com/email-edit>

You may use this command multiple times with the same user account to
authorize on a new machine.  When authenticating on a new machine,
the username, password and email address must all match with
your existing record.

`npm login` is an alias to `adduser` and behaves exactly the same way.

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
#### `registry`

* Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry.

#### `scope`

* Default: the scope of the current project, if any, or ""
* Type: String

Associate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry.

Useful when logging in to or out of a private registry:

```
# log in, linking the scope to the custom registry
npm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry.mycorp.com

# log out, removing the link and the auth token
npm logout --scope=@mycorp
```

This will cause `@mycorp` to be mapped to the registry for future
installation of packages specified according to the pattern
`@mycorp/package`.

This will also cause `npm init` to create a scoped package.

```
# accept all defaults, and create a package named "@foo/whatever",
# instead of just named "whatever"
npm init --scope=@foo --yes
```
