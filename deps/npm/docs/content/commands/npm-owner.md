Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Manage ownership of published packages.

* ls: List all the users who have access to modify a package and push new
  versions.  Handy when you need to know who to bug for help.
* add: Add a new user as a maintainer of a package.  This user is enabled
  to modify metadata, publish new versions, and add other owners.
* rm: Remove a user from the package owner list.  This immediately revokes
  their privileges.

Note that there is only one level of access.  Either you can modify a package,
or you can't.  Future versions may contain more fine-grained access levels, but
that is not implemented at this time.

If you have two-factor authentication enabled with `auth-and-writes` (see
[`npm-profile`](/commands/npm-profile)) then you'll need to include an otp
on the command line when changing ownership with `--otp`.

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->
#### `registry`

* Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`.

If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.
