### Synopsis

```bash
npm hook ls [pkg]
npm hook add <entity> <url> <secret>
npm hook update <id> <url> [secret]
npm hook rm <id>
```

Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

### Description

Allows you to manage [npm
hooks](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/145260155635/introducing-hooks-get-notifications-of-npm),
including adding, removing, listing, and updating.

Hooks allow you to configure URL endpoints that will be notified whenever a
change happens to any of the supported entity types. Three different types
of entities can be watched by hooks: packages, owners, and scopes.

To create a package hook, simply reference the package name.

To create an owner hook, prefix the owner name with `~` (as in,
`~youruser`).

To create a scope hook, prefix the scope name with `@` (as in,
`@yourscope`).

The hook `id` used by `update` and `rm` are the IDs listed in `npm hook ls`
for that particular hook.

The shared secret will be sent along to the URL endpoint so you can verify
the request came from your own configured hook.

### Example

Add a hook to watch a package for changes:

```bash
$ npm hook add lodash https://example.com/ my-shared-secret
```

Add a hook to watch packages belonging to the user `substack`:

```bash
$ npm hook add ~substack https://example.com/ my-shared-secret
```

Add a hook to watch packages in the scope `@npm`

```bash
$ npm hook add @npm https://example.com/ my-shared-secret
```

List all your active hooks:

```bash
$ npm hook ls
```

List your active hooks for the `lodash` package:

```bash
$ npm hook ls lodash
```

Update an existing hook's url:

```bash
$ npm hook update id-deadbeef https://my-new-website.here/
```

Remove a hook:

```bash
$ npm hook rm id-deadbeef
```

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
#### `registry`

* Default: "https://registry.npmjs.org/"
* Type: URL

The base URL of the npm registry.

#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`.

If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.
