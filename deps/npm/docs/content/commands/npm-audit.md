description: Run a security audit

### Synopsis

```bash
npm audit [fix|signatures]
```

### Description

The audit command submits a description of the dependencies configured in
your project to your default registry and asks for a report of known
vulnerabilities.  If any vulnerabilities are found, then the impact and
appropriate remediation will be calculated.  If the `fix` argument is
provided, then remediations will be applied to the package tree.

The command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities were found.

Note that some vulnerabilities cannot be fixed automatically and will
require manual intervention or review.  Also note that since `npm audit
fix` runs a full-fledged `npm install` under the hood, all configs that
apply to the installer will also apply to `npm install` -- so things like
`npm audit fix --package-lock-only` will work as expected.

By default, the audit command will exit with a non-zero code if any
vulnerability is found. It may be useful in CI environments to include the
`--audit-level` parameter to specify the minimum vulnerability level that
will cause the command to fail. This option does not filter the report
output, it simply changes the command's failure threshold.

### Package lock

By default npm requires a package-lock or shrinkwrap in order to run the
audit.  You can bypass the package lock with `--no-package-lock` but be
aware the results may be different with every run, since npm will
re-build the dependency tree each time.

### Audit Signatures

To ensure the integrity of packages you download from the public npm registry, or any registry that supports signatures, you can verify the registry signatures of downloaded packages using the npm CLI.

Registry signatures can be verified using the following `audit` command:

```bash
$ npm audit signatures
```

The `audit signatures` command will also verify the provenance attestations of
downloaded packages. Because provenance attestations are such a new feature,
security features may be added to (or changed in) the attestation format over
time. To ensure that you're always able to verify attestation signatures check
that you're running the latest version of the npm CLI. Please note this often
means updating npm beyond the version that ships with Node.js.

The npm CLI supports registry signatures and signing keys provided by any registry if the following conventions are followed:

1. Signatures are provided in the package's `packument` in each published version within the `dist` object:

```json
"dist":{
  "..omitted..": "..omitted..",
  "signatures": [{
    "keyid": "SHA256:{{SHA256_PUBLIC_KEY}}",
    "sig": "a312b9c3cb4a1b693e8ebac5ee1ca9cc01f2661c14391917dcb111517f72370809..."
  }]
}
```

See this [example](https://registry.npmjs.org/light-cycle/1.4.3) of a signed package from the public npm registry.

The `sig` is generated using the following template: `${package.name}@${package.version}:${package.dist.integrity}` and the `keyid` has to match one of the public signing keys below.

2. Public signing keys are provided at `registry-host.tld/-/npm/v1/keys` in the following format:

```
{
  "keys": [{
    "expires": null,
    "keyid": "SHA256:{{SHA256_PUBLIC_KEY}}",
    "keytype": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256",
    "scheme": "ecdsa-sha2-nistp256",
    "key": "{{B64_PUBLIC_KEY}}"
  }]
}
```

Keys response:

- `expires`: null or a simplified extended [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601): `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`
- `keydid`: sha256 fingerprint of the public key
- `keytype`: only `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` is currently supported by the npm CLI
- `scheme`: only `ecdsa-sha2-nistp256` is currently supported by the npm CLI
- `key`: base64 encoded public key

See this [example key's response from the public npm registry](https://registry.npmjs.org/-/npm/v1/keys).

### Audit Endpoints

There are two audit endpoints that npm may use to fetch vulnerability
information: the `Bulk Advisory` endpoint and the `Quick Audit` endpoint.

#### Bulk Advisory Endpoint

As of version 7, npm uses the much faster `Bulk Advisory` endpoint to
optimize the speed of calculating audit results.

npm will generate a JSON payload with the name and list of versions of each
package in the tree, and POST it to the default configured registry at
the path `/-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk`.

Any packages in the tree that do not have a `version` field in their
package.json file will be ignored.  If any `--omit` options are specified
(either via the [`--omit` config](/using-npm/config#omit), or one of the
shorthands such as `--production`, `--only=dev`, and so on), then packages will
be omitted from the submitted payload as appropriate.

If the registry responds with an error, or with an invalid response, then
npm will attempt to load advisory data from the `Quick Audit` endpoint.

The expected result will contain a set of advisory objects for each
dependency that matches the advisory range.  Each advisory object contains
a `name`, `url`, `id`, `severity`, `vulnerable_versions`, and `title`.

npm then uses these advisory objects to calculate vulnerabilities and
meta-vulnerabilities of the dependencies within the tree.

#### Quick Audit Endpoint

If the `Bulk Advisory` endpoint returns an error, or invalid data, npm will
attempt to load advisory data from the `Quick Audit` endpoint, which is
considerably slower in most cases.

The full package tree as found in `package-lock.json` is submitted, along
with the following pieces of additional metadata:

* `npm_version`
* `node_version`
* `platform`
* `arch`
* `node_env`

All packages in the tree are submitted to the Quick Audit endpoint.
Omitted dependency types are skipped when generating the report.

#### Scrubbing

Out of an abundance of caution, npm versions 5 and 6 would "scrub" any
packages from the submitted report if their name contained a `/` character,
so as to avoid leaking the names of potentially private packages or git
URLs.

However, in practice, this resulted in audits often failing to properly
detect meta-vulnerabilities, because the tree would appear to be invalid
due to missing dependencies, and prevented the detection of vulnerabilities
in package trees that used git dependencies or private modules.

This scrubbing has been removed from npm as of version 7.

#### Calculating Meta-Vulnerabilities and Remediations

npm uses the
[`@npmcli/metavuln-calculator`](http://npm.im/@npmcli/metavuln-calculator)
module to turn a set of security advisories into a set of "vulnerability"
objects.  A "meta-vulnerability" is a dependency that is vulnerable by
virtue of dependence on vulnerable versions of a vulnerable package.

For example, if the package `foo` is vulnerable in the range `>=1.0.2
<2.0.0`, and the package `bar` depends on `foo@^1.1.0`, then that version
of `bar` can only be installed by installing a vulnerable version of `foo`.
In this case, `bar` is a "metavulnerability".

Once metavulnerabilities for a given package are calculated, they are
cached in the `~/.npm` folder and only re-evaluated if the advisory range
changes, or a new version of the package is published (in which case, the
new version is checked for metavulnerable status as well).

If the chain of metavulnerabilities extends all the way to the root
project, and it cannot be updated without changing its dependency ranges,
then `npm audit fix` will require the `--force` option to apply the
remediation.  If remediations do not require changes to the dependency
ranges, then all vulnerable packages will be updated to a version that does
not have an advisory or metavulnerability posted against it.

### Exit Code

The `npm audit` command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities
were found.  The `npm audit fix` command will exit with 0 exit code if no
vulnerabilities are found _or_ if the remediation is able to successfully
fix all vulnerabilities.

If vulnerabilities were found the exit code will depend on the
[`audit-level` config](/using-npm/config#audit-level).

### Examples

Scan your project for vulnerabilities and automatically install any compatible
updates to vulnerable dependencies:

```bash
$ npm audit fix
```

Run `audit fix` without modifying `node_modules`, but still updating the
pkglock:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --package-lock-only
```

Skip updating `devDependencies`:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --only=prod
```

Have `audit fix` install SemVer-major updates to toplevel dependencies, not
just SemVer-compatible ones:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --force
```

Do a dry run to get an idea of what `audit fix` will do, and _also_ output
install information in JSON format:

```bash
$ npm audit fix --dry-run --json
```

Scan your project for vulnerabilities and just show the details, without
fixing anything:

```bash
$ npm audit
```

Get the detailed audit report in JSON format:

```bash
$ npm audit --json
```

Fail an audit only if the results include a vulnerability with a level of moderate or higher:

```bash
$ npm audit --audit-level=moderate
```

### Configuration

#### `audit-level`

* Default: null
* Type: null, "info", "low", "moderate", "high", "critical", or "none"

The minimum level of vulnerability for `npm audit` to exit with a non-zero
exit code.



#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done. This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`.

Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc.



#### `force`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Removes various protections against unfortunate side effects, common
mistakes, unnecessary performance degradation, and malicious input.

* Allow clobbering non-npm files in global installs.
* Allow the `npm version` command to work on an unclean git repository.
* Allow deleting the cache folder with `npm cache clean`.
* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of npm.
* Allow installing packages that have an `engines` declaration requiring a
  different version of `node`, even if `--engine-strict` is enabled.
* Allow `npm audit fix` to install modules outside your stated dependency
  range (including SemVer-major changes).
* Allow unpublishing all versions of a published package.
* Allow conflicting peerDependencies to be installed in the root project.
* Implicitly set `--yes` during `npm init`.
* Allow clobbering existing values in `npm pkg`
* Allow unpublishing of entire packages (not just a single version).

If you don't have a clear idea of what you want to do, it is strongly
recommended that you do not use this option!



#### `json`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Whether or not to output JSON data, rather than the normal output.

* In `npm pkg set` it enables parsing set values with JSON.parse() before
  saving them to your `package.json`.

Not supported by all npm commands.



#### `package-lock-only`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If set to true, the current operation will only use the `package-lock.json`,
ignoring `node_modules`.

For `update` this means only the `package-lock.json` will be updated,
instead of checking `node_modules` and downloading dependencies.

For `list` this means the output will be based on the tree described by the
`package-lock.json`, rather than the contents of `node_modules`.



#### `package-lock`

* Default: true
* Type: Boolean

If set to false, then ignore `package-lock.json` files when installing. This
will also prevent _writing_ `package-lock.json` if `save` is true.



#### `omit`

* Default: 'dev' if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to
  'production', otherwise empty.
* Type: "dev", "optional", or "peer" (can be set multiple times)

Dependency types to omit from the installation tree on disk.

Note that these dependencies _are_ still resolved and added to the
`package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` file. They are just not
physically installed on disk.

If a package type appears in both the `--include` and `--omit` lists, then
it will be included.

If the resulting omit list includes `'dev'`, then the `NODE_ENV` environment
variable will be set to `'production'` for all lifecycle scripts.



#### `include`

* Default:
* Type: "prod", "dev", "optional", or "peer" (can be set multiple times)

Option that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install.

This is the inverse of `--omit=<type>`.

Dependency types specified in `--include` will not be omitted, regardless of
the order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line.



#### `foreground-scripts`

* Default: `false` unless when using `npm pack` or `npm publish` where it
  defaults to `true`
* Type: Boolean

Run all build scripts (ie, `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall`)
scripts for installed packages in the foreground process, sharing standard
input, output, and error with the main npm process.

Note that this will generally make installs run slower, and be much noisier,
but can be useful for debugging.



#### `ignore-scripts`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

If true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.

Note that commands explicitly intended to run a particular script, such as
`npm start`, `npm stop`, `npm restart`, `npm test`, and `npm run` will still
run their intended script if `ignore-scripts` is set, but they will *not*
run any pre- or post-scripts.



#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option.

Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces.

Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether. When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc.)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder. - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc.) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command.

When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

#### `install-links`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

When set file: protocol dependencies will be packed and installed as regular
dependencies instead of creating a symlink. This option has no effect on
workspaces.
