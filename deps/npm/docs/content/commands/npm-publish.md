### Synopsis

```bash
npm publish [<tarball>|<folder>] [--tag <tag>] [--access <public|restricted>] [--otp otpcode] [--dry-run]

Publishes '.' if no argument supplied
Sets tag 'latest' if no --tag specified
```

### Description

Publishes a package to the registry so that it can be installed by name.

By default npm will publish to the public registry. This can be overridden
by specifying a different default registry or using a
[`scope`](/using-npm/scope) in the name (see
[`package.json`](/configuring-npm/package-json)).

* `<folder>`: A folder containing a package.json file

* `<tarball>`: A url or file path to a gzipped tar archive containing a
  single folder with a package.json file inside.

* `[--tag <tag>]`: Registers the published package with the given tag, such
  that `npm install <name>@<tag>` will install this version.  By default,
  `npm publish` updates and `npm install` installs the `latest` tag. See
  [`npm-dist-tag`](npm-dist-tag) for details about tags.

* `[--access <public|restricted>]`: Tells the registry whether this package
  should be published as public or restricted. Only applies to scoped
  packages, which default to `restricted`.  If you don't have a paid
  account, you must publish with `--access public` to publish scoped
  packages.

* `[--otp <otpcode>]`: If you have two-factor authentication enabled in
  `auth-and-writes` mode then you can provide a code from your
  authenticator with this. If you don't include this and you're running
  from a TTY then you'll be prompted.

* `[--dry-run]`: As of `npm@6`, does everything publish would do except
  actually publishing to the registry. Reports the details of what would
  have been published.

* `[--workspaces]`: Enables workspace context while publishing. All
  workspace packages will be published.

* `[--workspace]`: Enables workspaces context and limits results to only
  those specified by this config item.  Only the packages in the
  workspaces given will be published.

The publish will fail if the package name and version combination already
exists in the specified registry.

Once a package is published with a given name and version, that specific
name and version combination can never be used again, even if it is removed
with [`npm unpublish`](/commands/npm-unpublish).

As of `npm@5`, both a sha1sum and an integrity field with a sha512sum of the
tarball will be submitted to the registry during publication. Subsequent
installs will use the strongest supported algorithm to verify downloads.

Similar to `--dry-run` see [`npm pack`](/commands/npm-pack), which figures
out the files to be included and packs them into a tarball to be uploaded
to the registry.

### Files included in package

To see what will be included in your package, run `npx npm-packlist`.  All
files are included by default, with the following exceptions:

- Certain files that are relevant to package installation and distribution
  are always included.  For example, `package.json`, `README.md`,
  `LICENSE`, and so on.

- If there is a "files" list in
  [`package.json`](/configuring-npm/package-json), then only the files
  specified will be included.  (If directories are specified, then they
  will be walked recursively and their contents included, subject to the
  same ignore rules.)

- If there is a `.gitignore` or `.npmignore` file, then ignored files in
  that and all child directories will be excluded from the package.  If
  _both_ files exist, then the `.gitignore` is ignored, and only the
  `.npmignore` is used.

  `.npmignore` files follow the [same pattern
  rules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#_ignoring)
  as `.gitignore` files

- If the file matches certain patterns, then it will _never_ be included,
  unless explicitly added to the `"files"` list in `package.json`, or
  un-ignored with a `!` rule in a `.npmignore` or `.gitignore` file.

- Symbolic links are never included in npm packages.


See [`developers`](/using-npm/developers) for full details on what's
included in the published package, as well as details on how the package is
built.

### Configuration

<!-- AUTOGENERATED CONFIG DESCRIPTIONS START -->
<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->
#### `tag`

* Default: "latest"
* Type: String

If you ask npm to install a package and don't tell it a specific version,
then it will install the specified tag.

Also the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the `npm tag`
command, if no explicit tag is given.

When used by the `npm diff` command, this is the tag used to fetch the
tarball that will be compared with the local files by default.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `access`

* Default: 'restricted' for scoped packages, 'public' for unscoped packages
* Type: null, "restricted", or "public"

When publishing scoped packages, the access level defaults to `restricted`.
If you want your scoped package to be publicly viewable (and installable)
set `--access=public`. The only valid values for `access` are `public` and
`restricted`. Unscoped packages _always_ have an access level of `public`.

Note: Using the `--access` flag on the `npm publish` command will only set
the package access level on the initial publish of the package. Any
subsequent `npm publish` commands using the `--access` flag will not have an
effect to the access level. To make changes to the access level after the
initial publish use `npm access`.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `dry-run`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Indicates that you don't want npm to make any changes and that it should
only report what it would have done. This can be passed into any of the
commands that modify your local installation, eg, `install`, `update`,
`dedupe`, `uninstall`, as well as `pack` and `publish`.

Note: This is NOT honored by other network related commands, eg `dist-tags`,
`owner`, etc.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `otp`

* Default: null
* Type: null or String

This is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed
when publishing or changing package permissions with `npm access`.

If not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time
password, npm will prompt on the command line for one.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `workspace`

* Default:
* Type: String (can be set multiple times)

Enable running a command in the context of the configured workspaces of the
current project while filtering by running only the workspaces defined by
this configuration option.

Valid values for the `workspace` config are either:

* Workspace names
* Path to a workspace directory
* Path to a parent workspace directory (will result in selecting all
  workspaces within that folder)

When set for the `npm init` command, this may be set to the folder of a
workspace which does not yet exist, to create the folder and set it up as a
brand new workspace within the project.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `workspaces`

* Default: null
* Type: null or Boolean

Set to true to run the command in the context of **all** configured
workspaces.

Explicitly setting this to false will cause commands like `install` to
ignore workspaces altogether. When not set explicitly:

- Commands that operate on the `node_modules` tree (install, update, etc.)
will link workspaces into the `node_modules` folder. - Commands that do
other things (test, exec, publish, etc.) will operate on the root project,
_unless_ one or more workspaces are specified in the `workspace` config.

This value is not exported to the environment for child processes.

<!-- automatically generated, do not edit manually -->
<!-- see lib/utils/config/definitions.js -->

#### `include-workspace-root`

* Default: false
* Type: Boolean

Include the workspace root when workspaces are enabled for a command.

When false, specifying individual workspaces via the `workspace` config, or
all workspaces via the `workspaces` flag, will cause npm to operate only on
the specified workspaces, and not on the root project.
