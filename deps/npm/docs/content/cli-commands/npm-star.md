# npm-star

## Mark your favorite packages

### Synopsis

```bash
npm star [<pkg>...]
npm unstar [<pkg>...]
```

### Description

"Starring" a package means that you have some interest in it.  It's
a vaguely positive way to show that you care.

"Unstarring" is the same thing, but in reverse.

It's a boolean thing.  Starring repeatedly has no additional effect.
