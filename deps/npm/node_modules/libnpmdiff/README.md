### API

#### `> libnpmdif([ a, b ], [opts]) -> Promise<String>`

Fetches the registry tarballs and compare files between a spec `a` and spec `b`. **npm** spec types are usually described in `<pkg-name>@<version>` form but multiple other types are alsos supported, for more info on valid specs take a look at [`npm-package-arg`](https://github.com/npm/npm-package-arg).

**Options**:

- `color <Boolean>`: Should add ANSI colors to string output? Defaults to `false`.
- `tagVersionPrefix <Sring>`: What prefix should be used to define version numbers. Defaults to `v`
- `diffUnified <Number>`: How many lines of code to print before/after each diff. Defaults to `3`.
- `diffFiles <Array<String>>`: If set only prints patches for the files listed in this array (also accepts globs). Defaults to `undefined`.
- `diffIgnoreAllSpace <Boolean>`: Whether or not should ignore changes in whitespace (very useful to avoid indentation changes extra diff lines). Defaults to `false`.
- `diffNameOnly <Boolean>`: Prints only file names and no patch diffs. Defaults to `false`.
- `diffNoPrefix <Boolean>`: If true then skips printing any prefixes in filenames. Defaults to `false`.
- `diffSrcPrefix <String>`: Prefix to be used in the filenames from `a`. Defaults to `a/`.
- `diffDstPrefix <String>`: Prefix to be used in the filenames from `b`. Defaults to `b/`.
- `diffText <Boolean>`: Should treat all files as text and try to print diff for binary files. Defaults to `false`.
- ...`cache`, `registry`, `where` and other common options accepted by [pacote](https://github.com/npm/pacote#options)

Returns a `Promise` that fullfils with a `String` containing the resulting patch diffs.

Throws an error if either `a` or `b` are missing or if trying to diff more than two specs.
