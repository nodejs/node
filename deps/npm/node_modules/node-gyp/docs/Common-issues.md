## Python Issues OSX

Make sure you are using the native Python version in OSX.  If you use a MacPorts of HomeBrew version, you may run into problems.

If you have issues with `execvp`, be sure to check your `$PYTHON` environment variable.  If it is not set to the native version, unset it and try again.
