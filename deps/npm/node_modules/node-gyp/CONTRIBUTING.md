# Contributing to node-gyp

## Making changes to gyp-next

Changes in the subfolder `gyp/` should be submitted to the
[`gyp-next`][] repository first. The `gyp/` folder is regularly
synced from [`gyp-next`][] with GitHub Actions workflow
[`update-gyp-next.yml`](.github/workflows/update-gyp-next.yml),
and any changes in this folder would be overridden by the workflow.
