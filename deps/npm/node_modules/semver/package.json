  "readme": "semver(1) -- The semantic versioner for npm\n===========================================\n\n## Usage\n\n    $ npm install semver\n\n    semver.valid('1.2.3') // '1.2.3'\n    semver.valid('a.b.c') // null\n    semver.clean('  =v1.2.3   ') // '1.2.3'\n    semver.satisfies('1.2.3', '1.x || >=2.5.0 || 5.0.0 - 7.2.3') // true\n    semver.gt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // false\n    semver.lt('1.2.3', '9.8.7') // true\n\nAs a command-line utility:\n\n    $ semver -h\n\n    Usage: semver <version> [<version> [...]] [-r <range> | -i <inc> | -d <dec>]\n    Test if version(s) satisfy the supplied range(s), and sort them.\n\n    Multiple versions or ranges may be supplied, unless increment\n    or decrement options are specified.  In that case, only a single\n    version may be used, and it is incremented by the specified level\n\n    Program exits successfully if any valid version satisfies\n    all supplied ranges, and prints all satisfying versions.\n\n    If no versions are valid, or ranges are not satisfied,\n    then exits failure.\n\n    Versions are printed in ascending order, so supplying\n    multiple versions to the utility will just sort them.\n\n## Versions\n\nA \"version\" is described by the v2.0.0 specification found at\n<http://semver.org/>.\n\nA leading `\"=\"` or `\"v\"` character is stripped off and ignored.\n\n## Ranges\n\nThe following range styles are supported:\n\n* `1.2.3` A specific version.  When nothing else will do.  Note that\n  build metadata is still ignored, so `1.2.3+build2012` will satisfy\n  this range.\n* `>1.2.3` Greater than a specific version.\n* `<1.2.3` Less than a specific version.  If there is no prerelease\n  tag on the version range, then no prerelease version will be allowed\n  either, even though these are technically \"less than\".\n* `>=1.2.3` Greater than or equal to.  Note that prerelease versions\n  are NOT equal to their \"normal\" equivalents, so `1.2.3-beta` will\n  not satisfy this range, but `2.3.0-beta` will.\n* `<=1.2.3` Less than or equal to.  In this case, prerelease versions\n  ARE allowed, so `1.2.3-beta` would satisfy.\n* `1.2.3 - 2.3.4` := `>=1.2.3 <=2.3.4`\n* `~1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3-0 <1.3.0-0`  \"Reasonably close to 1.2.3\".  When\n  using tilde operators, prerelease versions are supported as well,\n  but a prerelease of the next significant digit will NOT be\n  satisfactory, so `1.3.0-beta` will not satisfy `~1.2.3`.\n* `^1.2.3` := `>=1.2.3-0 <2.0.0-0`  \"Compatible with 1.2.3\".  When\n  using caret operators, anything from the specified version (including\n  prerelease) will be supported up to, but not including, the next\n  major version (or its prereleases). `1.5.1` will satisfy `^1.2.3`,\n  while `1.2.2` and `2.0.0-beta` will not.\n* `^0.1.3` := `>=0.1.3-0 <0.2.0-0` \"Compatible with 0.1.3\". 0.x.x versions are\n  special: the first non-zero component indicates potentially breaking changes,\n  meaning the caret operator matches any version with the same first non-zero\n  component starting at the specified version.\n* `^0.0.2` := `=0.0.2` \"Only the version 0.0.2 is considered compatible\"\n* `~1.2` := `>=1.2.0-0 <1.3.0-0` \"Any version starting with 1.2\"\n* `^1.2` := `>=1.2.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version compatible with 1.2\"\n* `1.2.x` := `>=1.2.0-0 <1.3.0-0` \"Any version starting with 1.2\"\n* `~1` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version starting with 1\"\n* `^1` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version compatible with 1\"\n* `1.x` := `>=1.0.0-0 <2.0.0-0` \"Any version starting with 1\"\n\n\nRanges can be joined with either a space (which implies \"and\") or a\n`||` (which implies \"or\").\n\n## Functions\n\nAll methods and classes take a final `loose` boolean argument that, if\ntrue, will be more forgiving about not-quite-valid semver strings.\nThe resulting output will always be 100% strict, of course.\n\nStrict-mode Comparators and Ranges will be strict about the SemVer\nstrings that they parse.\n\n* valid(v): Return the parsed version, or null if it's not valid.\n* inc(v, release): Return the version incremented by the release type\n  (major, minor, patch, or prerelease), or null if it's not valid.\n\n### Comparison\n\n* gt(v1, v2): `v1 > v2`\n* gte(v1, v2): `v1 >= v2`\n* lt(v1, v2): `v1 < v2`\n* lte(v1, v2): `v1 <= v2`\n* eq(v1, v2): `v1 == v2` This is true if they're logically equivalent,\n  even if they're not the exact same string.  You already know how to\n  compare strings.\n* neq(v1, v2): `v1 != v2` The opposite of eq.\n* cmp(v1, comparator, v2): Pass in a comparison string, and it'll call\n  the corresponding function above.  `\"===\"` and `\"!==\"` do simple\n  string comparison, but are included for completeness.  Throws if an\n  invalid comparison string is provided.\n* compare(v1, v2): Return 0 if v1 == v2, or 1 if v1 is greater, or -1 if\n  v2 is greater.  Sorts in ascending order if passed to Array.sort().\n* rcompare(v1, v2): The reverse of compare.  Sorts an array of versions\n  in descending order when passed to Array.sort().\n\n\n### Ranges\n\n* validRange(range): Return the valid range or null if it's not valid\n* satisfies(version, range): Return true if the version satisfies the\n  range.\n* maxSatisfying(versions, range): Return the highest version in the list\n  that satisfies the range, or null if none of them do.\n",
