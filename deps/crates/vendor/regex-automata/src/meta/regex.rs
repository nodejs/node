/// A regex matcher that works by composing several other regex matchers
/// automatically.
///
/// In effect, a meta regex papers over a lot of the quirks or performance
/// problems in each of the regex engines in this crate. Its goal is to provide
/// an infallible and simple API that "just does the right thing" in the common
/// case.
///
/// A meta regex is the implementation of a `Regex` in the `regex` crate.
/// Indeed, the `regex` crate API is essentially just a light wrapper over
/// this type. This includes the `regex` crate's `RegexSet` API!
///
/// # Composition
///
/// This is called a "meta" matcher precisely because it uses other regex
/// matchers to provide a convenient high level regex API. Here are some
/// examples of how other regex matchers are composed:
///
/// * When calling [`Regex::captures`], instead of immediately
/// running a slower but more capable regex engine like the
/// [`PikeVM`](crate::nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM), the meta regex engine
/// will usually first look for the bounds of a match with a higher throughput
/// regex engine like a [lazy DFA](crate::hybrid). Only when a match is found
/// is a slower engine like `PikeVM` used to find the matching span for each
/// capture group.
/// * While higher throughout engines like the lazy DFA cannot handle
/// Unicode word boundaries in general, they can still be used on pure ASCII
/// haystacks by pretending that Unicode word boundaries are just plain ASCII
/// word boundaries. However, if a haystack is not ASCII, the meta regex engine
/// will automatically switch to a (possibly slower) regex engine that supports
/// Unicode word boundaries in general.
/// * In some cases where a regex pattern is just a simple literal or a small
/// set of literals, an actual regex engine won't be used at all. Instead,
/// substring or multi-substring search algorithms will be employed.
///
/// There are many other forms of composition happening too, but the above
/// should give a general idea. In particular, it may perhaps be surprising
/// that *multiple* regex engines might get executed for a single search. That
/// is, the decision of what regex engine to use is not _just_ based on the
/// pattern, but also based on the dynamic execution of the search itself.
///
/// The primary reason for this composition is performance. The fundamental
/// tension is that the faster engines tend to be less capable, and the more
/// capable engines tend to be slower.
///
/// Note that the forms of composition that are allowed are determined by
/// compile time crate features and configuration. For example, if the `hybrid`
/// feature isn't enabled, or if [`Config::hybrid`] has been disabled, then the
/// meta regex engine will never use a lazy DFA.
///
/// # Synchronization and cloning
///
/// Most of the regex engines in this crate require some kind of mutable
/// "scratch" space to read and write from while performing a search. Since
/// a meta regex composes these regex engines, a meta regex also requires
/// mutable scratch space. This scratch space is called a [`Cache`].
///
/// Most regex engines _also_ usually have a read-only component, typically
/// a [Thompson `NFA`](crate::nfa::thompson::NFA).
///
/// In order to make the `Regex` API convenient, most of the routines hide
/// the fact that a `Cache` is needed at all. To achieve this, a [memory
/// pool](crate::util::pool::Pool) is used internally to retrieve `Cache`
/// values in a thread safe way that also permits reuse. This in turn implies
/// that every such search call requires some form of synchronization. Usually
/// this synchronization is fast enough to not notice, but in some cases, it
/// can be a bottleneck. This typically occurs when all of the following are
/// true:
///
/// * The same `Regex` is shared across multiple threads simultaneously,
/// usually via a [`util::lazy::Lazy`](crate::util::lazy::Lazy) or something
/// similar from the `once_cell` or `lazy_static` crates.
/// * The primary unit of work in each thread is a regex search.
/// * Searches are run on very short haystacks.
///
/// This particular case can lead to high contention on the pool used by a
/// `Regex` internally, which can in turn increase latency to a noticeable
/// effect. This cost can be mitigated in one of the following ways:
///
/// * Use a distinct copy of a `Regex` in each thread, usually by cloning it.
/// Cloning a `Regex` _does not_ do a deep copy of its read-only component.
/// But it does lead to each `Regex` having its own memory pool, which in
/// turn eliminates the problem of contention. In general, this technique should
/// not result in any additional memory usage when compared to sharing the same
/// `Regex` across multiple threads simultaneously.
/// * Use lower level APIs, like [`Regex::search_with`], which permit passing
/// a `Cache` explicitly. In this case, it is up to you to determine how best
/// to provide a `Cache`. For example, you might put a `Cache` in thread-local
/// storage if your use case allows for it.
///
/// Overall, this is an issue that happens rarely in practice, but it can
/// happen.
///
/// # Warning: spin-locks may be used in alloc-only mode
///
/// When this crate is built without the `std` feature and the high level APIs
/// on a `Regex` are used, then a spin-lock will be used to synchronize access
/// to an internal pool of `Cache` values. This may be undesirable because
/// a spin-lock is [effectively impossible to implement correctly in user
/// space][spinlocks-are-bad]. That is, more concretely, the spin-lock could
/// result in a deadlock.
///
/// [spinlocks-are-bad]: https://matklad.github.io/2020/01/02/spinlocks-considered-harmful.html
///
/// If one wants to avoid the use of spin-locks when the `std` feature is
/// disabled, then you must use APIs that accept a `Cache` value explicitly.
/// For example, [`Regex::search_with`].
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::meta::Regex;
///
/// let re = Regex::new(r"^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$")?;
/// assert!(re.is_match("2010-03-14"));
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Example: anchored search
///
/// This example shows how to use [`Input::anchored`] to run an anchored
/// search, even when the regex pattern itself isn't anchored. An anchored
/// search guarantees that if a match is found, then the start offset of the
/// match corresponds to the offset at which the search was started.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{meta::Regex, Anchored, Input, Match};
///
/// let re = Regex::new(r"\bfoo\b")?;
/// let input = Input::new("xx foo xx").range(3..).anchored(Anchored::Yes);
/// // The offsets are in terms of the original haystack.
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 3..6)), re.find(input));
///
/// // Notice that no match occurs here, because \b still takes the
/// // surrounding context into account, even if it means looking back
/// // before the start of your search.
/// let hay = "xxfoo xx";
/// let input = Input::new(hay).range(2..).anchored(Anchored::Yes);
/// assert_eq!(None, re.find(input));
/// // Indeed, you cannot achieve the above by simply slicing the
/// // haystack itself, since the regex engine can't see the
/// // surrounding context. This is why 'Input' permits setting
/// // the bounds of a search!
/// let input = Input::new(&hay[2..]).anchored(Anchored::Yes);
/// // WRONG!
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 0..3)), re.find(input));
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Example: earliest search
///
/// This example shows how to use [`Input::earliest`] to run a search that
/// might stop before finding the typical leftmost match.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{meta::Regex, Anchored, Input, Match};
///
/// let re = Regex::new(r"[a-z]{3}|b")?;
/// let input = Input::new("abc").earliest(true);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 1..2)), re.find(input));
///
/// // Note that "earliest" isn't really a match semantic unto itself.
/// // Instead, it is merely an instruction to whatever regex engine
/// // gets used internally to quit as soon as it can. For example,
/// // this regex uses a different search technique, and winds up
/// // producing a different (but valid) match!
/// let re = Regex::new(r"abc|b")?;
/// let input = Input::new("abc").earliest(true);
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 0..3)), re.find(input));
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())

///
/// ```

/// Represents mutable scratch space used by regex engines during a search.
///
/// Most of the regex engines in this crate require some kind of
/// mutable state in order to execute a search. This mutable state is
/// explicitly separated from the core regex object (such as a
/// [`thompson::NFA`](crate::nfa::thompson::NFA)) so that the read-only regex
/// object can be shared across multiple threads simultaneously without any
/// synchronization. Conversely, a `Cache` must either be duplicated if using
/// the same `Regex` from multiple threads, or else there must be some kind of
/// synchronization that guarantees exclusive access while it's in use by one
/// thread.
///
/// A `Regex` attempts to do this synchronization for you by using a thread
/// pool internally. Its size scales roughly with the number of simultaneous
/// regex searches.
///
/// For cases where one does not want to rely on a `Regex`'s internal thread
/// pool, lower level routines such as [`Regex::search_with`] are provided
/// that permit callers to pass a `Cache` into the search routine explicitly.
///
/// General advice is that the thread pool is often more than good enough.
/// However, it may be possible to observe the effects of its latency,
/// especially when searching many small haystacks from many threads
/// simultaneously.

/// [`Regex::create_cache`]. A cache can only be used with either the `Regex`
/// that created it, or the `Regex` that was most recently used to reset it
/// with [`Cache::reset`]. Using a cache with any other `Regex` may result in
/// panics or incorrect results.

/// This only applies when building a `Regex` from pattern strings.
///
/// Once configured, the builder can then be used to construct a `Regex` from
/// one of 4 different inputs:
///
/// * [`Builder::build`] creates a regex from a single pattern string.
/// * [`Builder::build_many`] creates a regex from many pattern strings.
/// * [`Builder::build_from_hir`] creates a regex from a
/// [`regex-syntax::Hir`](Hir) expression.
/// * [`Builder::build_many_from_hir`] creates a regex from many
/// [`regex-syntax::Hir`](Hir) expressions.
///
/// The latter two methods in particular provide a way to construct a fully
/// feature regular expression matcher directly from an `Hir` expression
/// without having to first convert it to a string. (This is in contrast to the
/// top-level `regex` crate which intentionally provides no such API in order
/// to avoid making `regex-syntax` a public dependency.)
///
/// As a convenience, this builder may be created via [`Regex::builder`], which
/// may help avoid an extra import.
///
/// # Example: change the line terminator
///
/// This example shows how to enable multi-line mode by default and change the
/// line terminator to the NUL byte:
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{meta::Regex, util::syntax, Match};
///
/// let re = Regex::builder()
///     .syntax(syntax::Config::new().multi_line(true))
///     .configure(Regex::config().line_terminator(b'\x00'))
///     .build(r"^foo$")?;
/// let hay = "\x00foo\x00";
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 1..4)), re.find(hay));
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Example: disable UTF-8 requirement
///
/// By default, regex patterns are required to match UTF-8. This includes
/// regex patterns that can produce matches of length zero. In the case of an
/// empty match, by default, matches will not appear between the code units of
/// a UTF-8 encoded codepoint.
///
/// However, it can be useful to disable this requirement, particularly if
/// you're searching things like `&[u8]` that are not known to be valid UTF-8.
///
/// ```
/// use regex_automata::{meta::Regex, util::syntax, Match};
///
/// let mut builder = Regex::builder();
/// // Disables the requirement that non-empty matches match UTF-8.
/// builder.syntax(syntax::Config::new().utf8(false));
/// // Disables the requirement that empty matches match UTF-8 boundaries.
/// builder.configure(Regex::config().utf8_empty(false));
///
/// // We can match raw bytes via \xZZ syntax, but we need to disable
/// // Unicode mode to do that. We could disable it everywhere, or just
/// // selectively, as shown here.
/// let re = builder.build(r"(?-u:\xFF)foo(?-u:\xFF)")?;
/// let hay = b"\xFFfoo\xFF";
/// assert_eq!(Some(Match::must(0, 0..5)), re.find(hay));
///
/// // We can also match between code units.
/// let re = builder.build(r"")?;
/// let hay = "☃";
/// assert_eq!(re.find_iter(hay).collect::<Vec<Match>>(), vec![
///     Match::must(0, 0..0),
///     Match::must(0, 1..1),
