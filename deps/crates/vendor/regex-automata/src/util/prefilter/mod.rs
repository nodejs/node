/*!
Defines a prefilter for accelerating regex searches.

A prefilter can be created by building a [`Prefilter`] value.

A prefilter represents one of the most important optimizations available for
accelerating regex searches. The idea of a prefilter is to very quickly find
candidate locations in a haystack where a regex _could_ match. Once a candidate
is found, it is then intended for the regex engine to run at that position to
determine whether the candidate is a match or a false positive.

In the aforementioned description of the prefilter optimization also lay its
demise. Namely, if a prefilter has a high false positive rate and it produces
lots of candidates, then a prefilter can overall make a regex search slower.
It can run more slowly because more time is spent ping-ponging between the
prefilter search and the regex engine attempting to confirm each candidate as
a match. This ping-ponging has overhead that adds up, and is exacerbated by
a high false positive rate.

Nevertheless, the optimization is still generally worth performing in most
cases. Particularly given just how much throughput can be improved. (It is not
uncommon for prefilter optimizations to improve throughput by one or two orders
of magnitude.)

Typically a prefilter is used to find occurrences of literal prefixes from a
regex pattern, but this isn't required. A prefilter can be used to look for
suffixes or even inner literals.

Note that as of now, prefilters throw away information about which pattern
each literal comes from. In other words, when a prefilter finds a match,
there's no way to know which pattern (or patterns) it came from. Therefore,
in order to confirm a match, you'll have to check all of the patterns by
running the full regex engine.

/// A prefilter for accelerating regex searches.
///
/// If you already have your literals that you want to search with,
/// then the vanilla [`Prefilter::new`] constructor is for you. But
/// if you have an [`Hir`] value from the `regex-syntax` crate, then
/// [`Prefilter::from_hir_prefix`] might be more convenient. Namely, it uses
/// the [`regex-syntax::hir::literal`](regex_syntax::hir::literal) module to
/// extract literal prefixes for you, optimize them and then select and build a
/// prefilter matcher.
///
/// A prefilter must have **zero false negatives**. However, by its very
/// nature, it may produce false positives. That is, a prefilter will never
/// skip over a position in the haystack that corresponds to a match of the
/// original regex pattern, but it *may* produce a match for a position
/// in the haystack that does *not* correspond to a match of the original
/// regex pattern. If you use either the [`Prefilter::from_hir_prefix`] or
/// [`Prefilter::from_hirs_prefix`] constructors, then this guarantee is
/// upheld for you automatically. This guarantee is not preserved if you use
/// [`Prefilter::new`] though, since it is up to the caller to provide correct
/// literal strings with respect to the original regex pattern.
///
/// # Cloning
///
/// It is an API guarantee that cloning a prefilter is cheap. That is, cloning
/// it will not duplicate whatever heap memory is used to represent the
/// underlying matcher.
///

///

/// [`PikeVM`](crate::nfa::thompson::pikevm::PikeVM) in order to accelerate
/// searches.
