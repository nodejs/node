# 2.3.3

## Changes to `-=`

The `-=` operator was incorrectly changed to truncate bits that didn't correspond to valid flags in `2.3.0`. This has
been fixed up so it once again behaves the same as `-` and `difference`.

## Changes to `!`

The `!` operator previously called `Self::from_bits_truncate`, which would truncate any bits that only partially
overlapped with a valid flag. It will now use `bits & Self::all().bits()`, so any bits that overlap any bits
specified by any flag will be respected. This is unlikely to have any practical implications, but enables defining
a flag like `const ALL = !0` as a way to signal that any bit pattern is a known set of flags.

## Changes to formatting

Zero-valued flags will never be printed. You'll either get `0x0` for empty flags using debug formatting, or the
set of flags with zero-valued flags omitted for others.

Composite flags will no longer be redundantly printed if there are extra bits to print at the end that don't correspond
to a valid flag.

## Major changes

### `BitFlags` trait deprecated in favor of `Flags` trait

This release introduces the `Flags` trait and deprecates the `BitFlags` trait. These two traits are semver compatible so if you have public API code depending on `BitFlags` you can move to `Flags` without breaking end-users. This is possible because the `BitFlags` trait was never publicly implementable, so it now carries `Flags` as a supertrait. All implementations of `Flags` additionally implement `BitFlags`.

The `Flags` trait is a publicly implementable version of the old `BitFlags` trait. The original `BitFlags` trait carried some macro baggage that made it difficult to implement, so a new `Flags` trait has been introduced as the _One True Trait_ for interacting with flags types generically. See the the `macro_free` and `custom_derive` examples for more details.

### `Bits` trait publicly exposed

The `Bits` trait for the underlying storage of flags values is also now publicly implementable. This lets you define your own exotic backing storage for flags. See the `custom_bits_type` example for more details.

## What's Changed
* Use explicit hashes for actions steps by @KodrAus in https://github.com/bitflags/bitflags/pull/350
* Support ejecting flags types from the bitflags macro by @KodrAus in https://github.com/bitflags/bitflags/pull/351

# 2.0.0

## Major changes

This release includes some major changes over `1.x`. If you use `bitflags!` types in your public API then upgrading this library may cause breakage in your downstream users.

### ⚠️ Serialization

You'll need to add the `serde` Cargo feature in order to `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` on your generated flags types:

```rust
bitflags! {
    #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
    #[serde(transparent)]
    pub struct Flags: T {
        ..
    }
}
```

where `T` is the underlying bits type you're using, such as `u32`.

The default serialization format with `serde` **has changed** if you `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` on your generated flags types. It will now use a formatted string for human-readable formats and the underlying bits type for compact formats.

To keep the old format, see the https://github.com/KodrAus/bitflags-serde-legacy library.

### ⚠️ Traits

Generated flags types now derive fewer traits. If you need to maintain backwards compatibility, you can derive the following yourself:

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, Hash, Debug, Clone, Copy)]
```

### ⚠️ Methods

The unsafe `from_bits_unchecked` method is now a safe `from_bits_retain` method.

You can add the following method to your generated types to keep them compatible:

```rust
#[deprecated = "use the safe `from_bits_retain` method instead"]
pub unsafe fn from_bits_unchecked(bits: T) -> Self {
    Self::from_bits_retain(bits)
}
```

where `T` is the underlying bits type you're using, such as `u32`.

### ⚠️ `.bits` field

You can now use the `.bits()` method instead of the old `.bits`.

The representation of generated flags types has changed from a struct with the single field `bits` to a newtype.

[#149]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/pull/149

# 1.0.1
- Add support for `pub(restricted)` specifier on the bitflags struct ([#135])
- Optimize performance of `all()` when called from a separate crate ([#136])

# 1.0.0
- **[breaking change]** Macro now generates [associated constants](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items.html#associated-constants) ([#24])

- **[breaking change]** Minimum supported version is Rust **1.20**, due to usage of associated constants

- After being broken in 0.9, the `#[deprecated]` attribute is now supported again ([#112])

- Other improvements to unit tests and documentation ([#106] and [#115])

## How to update your code to use associated constants
Assuming the following structure definition:
```rust
bitflags! {
  struct Something: u8 {
     const FOO = 0b01,
     const BAR = 0b10
  }
}
```
In 0.9 and older you could do:
```rust
let x = FOO.bits | BAR.bits;
```
Now you must use:
```rust
let x = Something::FOO.bits | Something::BAR.bits;
```

# 0.9.1
- Fix the implementation of `Formatting` traits when other formatting traits were present in scope ([#105])

[#105]: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/bitflags/pull/105

# 0.9.0
- **[breaking change]** Use struct keyword instead of flags to define bitflag types ([#84])

- **[breaking change]** Terminate const items with semicolons instead of commas ([#87])

- Implement the `Hex`, `Octal`, and `Binary` formatting traits ([#86])

- Printing an empty flag value with the `Debug` trait now prints "(empty)" instead of nothing ([#85])

- The `bitflags!` macro can now be used inside of a fn body, to define a type local to that function ([#74])

# 0.8.2
- Update feature flag used when building bitflags as a dependency of the Rust toolchain

# 0.8.1
- Allow bitflags to be used as a dependency of the Rust toolchain

# 0.8.0
- Add support for the experimental `i128` and `u128` integer types ([#57])

  This may break code that defines its own set method
