/// A compiled regular expression for searching Unicode haystacks.
///
/// A `Regex` can be used to search haystacks, split haystacks into substrings
/// or replace substrings in a haystack with a different substring. All
/// searching is done with an implicit `(?s:.)*?` at the beginning and end of
/// an pattern. To force an expression to match the whole string (or a prefix
/// or a suffix), you must use an anchor like `^` or `$` (or `\A` and `\z`).
///
/// While this crate will handle Unicode strings (whether in the regular
/// expression or in the haystack), all positions returned are **byte
/// offsets**. Every byte offset is guaranteed to be at a Unicode code point
/// boundary. That is, all offsets returned by the `Regex` API are guaranteed
/// to be ranges that can slice a `&str` without panicking. If you want to
/// relax this requirement, then you must search `&[u8]` haystacks with a
/// [`bytes::Regex`](crate::bytes::Regex).
///
/// The only methods that allocate new strings are the string replacement
/// methods. All other methods (searching and splitting) return borrowed
/// references into the haystack given.
///
/// # Example
///
/// Find the offsets of a US phone number:
///
/// ```
/// use regex::Regex;
///
/// let re = Regex::new("[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}").unwrap();
/// let m = re.find("phone: 111-222-3333").unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(7..19, m.range());
/// ```
///
/// # Example: extracting capture groups
///
/// A common way to use regexes is with capture groups. That is, instead of
/// just looking for matches of an entire regex, parentheses are used to create
/// groups that represent part of the match.
///
/// For example, consider a haystack with multiple lines, and each line has
/// three whitespace delimited fields where the second field is expected to be
/// a number and the third field a boolean. To make this convenient, we use
/// the [`Captures::extract`] API to put the strings that match each group
/// into a fixed size array:
///
/// ```
/// use regex::Regex;
///
/// let hay = "
/// rabbit         54 true
/// groundhog 2 true
/// does not match
/// fox   109    false
/// ";
/// let re = Regex::new(r"(?m)^\s*(\S+)\s+([0-9]+)\s+(true|false)\s*$").unwrap();
/// let mut fields: Vec<(&str, i64, bool)> = vec![];
/// for (_, [f1, f2, f3]) in re.captures_iter(hay).map(|caps| caps.extract()) {
///     fields.push((f1, f2.parse()?, f3.parse()?));
/// }
/// assert_eq!(fields, vec![
///     ("rabbit", 54, true),
///     ("groundhog", 2, true),
///     ("fox", 109, false),
/// ]);
///
/// # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Example: searching with the `Pattern` trait
///
/// **Note**: This section requires that this crate is compiled with the
/// `pattern` Cargo feature enabled, which **requires nightly Rust**.
///
/// Since `Regex` implements `Pattern` from the standard library, one can
/// use regexes with methods defined on `&str`. For example, `is_match`,
/// `find`, `find_iter` and `split` can, in some cases, be replaced with
/// `str::contains`, `str::find`, `str::match_indices` and `str::split`.
///
/// Here are some examples:
///
/// ```ignore
/// use regex::Regex;
///
/// let re = Regex::new(r"\d+").unwrap();
/// let hay = "a111b222c";
///
/// assert!(hay.contains(&re));
/// assert_eq!(hay.find(&re), Some(1));
/// assert_eq!(hay.match_indices(&re).collect::<Vec<_>>(), vec![
///     (1, "111"),
///     (5, "222"),
/// ]);
/// assert_eq!(hay.split(&re).collect::<Vec<_>>(), vec!["a", "b", "c"]);

    /// exert more precise control over the name, use braces, e.g., `${1}a`.
    ///
    /// To write a literal `$` use `$$`.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// Note that this function is polymorphic with respect to the replacement.

    /// a closure of type `|&Captures| -> String` provides direct access to the
    /// captures corresponding to a match. This allows one to access capturing

    ///
    /// ```

    ///     format!("{} {}", &caps[2], &caps[1])
    /// });
    /// assert_eq!(result, "Bruce Springsteen");
    /// ```
    ///
    /// But this is a bit cumbersome to use all the time. Instead, a simple
    /// syntax is supported (as described above) that expands `$name` into the
    /// corresponding capture group. Here's the last example, but using this
    /// expansion technique with named capture groups:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use regex::Regex;
    ///
    /// let re = Regex::new(r"(?<last>[^,\s]+),\s+(?<first>\S+)").unwrap();
    /// let result = re.replace("Springsteen, Bruce", "$first $last");
    /// assert_eq!(result, "Bruce Springsteen");
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Note that using `$2` instead of `$first` or `$1` instead of `$last`
    /// would produce the same result. To write a literal `$` use `$$`.
    ///
    /// Sometimes the replacement string requires use of curly braces to
    /// delineate a capture group replacement when it is adjacent to some other
    /// literal text. For example, if we wanted to join two words together with
    /// an underscore:
    ///
    /// ```
    /// use regex::Regex;
    ///
    /// let re = Regex::new(r"(?<first>\w+)\s+(?<second>\w+)").unwrap();
    /// let result = re.replace("deep fried", "${first}_$second");
    /// assert_eq!(result, "deep_fried");
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Without the curly braces, the capture group name `first_` would be
    /// used, and since it doesn't exist, it would be replaced with the empty
    /// string.
    ///
    /// Finally, sometimes you just want to replace a literal string with no
    /// regard for capturing group expansion. This can be done by wrapping a

    ///
    /// ```

/// For example, say you want to match the individual letters in a 5-letter

///
/// ```text
/// (?<first>\w)(\w)(?:\w)\w(?<last>\w)
/// ```
///
/// This regex has 4 capture groups:
///
/// * The group at index `0` corresponds to the overall match. It is always
/// present in every match and never has a name.
/// * The group at index `1` with name `first` corresponding to the first
/// letter.
/// * The group at index `2` with no name corresponding to the second letter.
/// * The group at index `3` with name `last` corresponding to the fifth and
/// last letter.
///
/// Notice that `(?:\w)` was not listed above as a capture group despite it
/// being enclosed in parentheses. That's because `(?:pattern)` is a special
/// syntax that permits grouping but *without* capturing. The reason for not
/// treating it as a capture is that tracking and reporting capture groups

    /// the number of capture groups in every match is always equivalent,

    /// the longest possible parse. So for example, `$1a` corresponds to the
    /// capture group named `1a` and not the capture group at index `1`. If
    /// `ref` matches `^[0-9]+$`, then it is treated as a capture group index
    /// itself and not a name.
    ///
    /// For the braced format, the format supported is `${ref}` where `ref` can
    /// be any sequence of bytes except for `}`. If no closing brace occurs,
    /// then it is not considered a capture reference. As with the unbraced
    /// format, if `ref` matches `^[0-9]+$`, then it is treated as a capture
    /// group index and not a name.
    ///
    /// The braced format is useful for exerting precise control over the name
    /// of the capture reference. For example, `${1}a` corresponds to the
    /// capture group reference `1` followed by the letter `a`, where as `$1a`
    /// (as mentioned above) corresponds to the capture group reference `1a`.
    /// The braced format is also useful for expressing capture group names
    /// that use characters not supported by the unbraced format. For example,
    /// `${foo[bar].baz}` refers to the capture group named `foo[bar].baz`.
