/// of the hash values of the keys.
///
/// The interface is closely compatible with the standard
/// [`HashMap`][std::collections::HashMap],
/// but also has additional features.
///
/// # Order
///
/// The key-value pairs have a consistent order that is determined by
/// the sequence of insertion and removal calls on the map. The order does
/// not depend on the keys or the hash function at all.
///
/// All iterators traverse the map in *the order*.
///
/// The insertion order is preserved, with **notable exceptions** like the
/// [`.remove()`][Self::remove] or [`.swap_remove()`][Self::swap_remove] methods.
/// Methods such as [`.sort_by()`][Self::sort_by] of
/// course result in a new order, depending on the sorting order.
///
/// # Indices
///
/// The key-value pairs are indexed in a compact range without holes in the
/// range `0..self.len()`. For example, the method `.get_full` looks up the
/// index for a key, and the method `.get_index` looks up the key-value pair by
/// index.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use indexmap::IndexMap;
///
/// // count the frequency of each letter in a sentence.
/// let mut letters = IndexMap::new();
/// for ch in "a short treatise on fungi".chars() {
///     *letters.entry(ch).or_insert(0) += 1;
/// }

/// assert_eq!(letters[&'s'], 2);
