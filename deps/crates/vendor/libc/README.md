# libc - Raw FFI bindings to platforms' system libraries

[![GHA Status]][GitHub Actions] [![Cirrus CI Status]][Cirrus CI] [![Latest Version]][crates.io] [![Documentation]][docs.rs] ![License]

`libc` provides all of the definitions necessary to easily interoperate with C
code (or "C-like" code) on each of the platforms that Rust supports. This
includes type definitions (e.g. `c_int`), constants (e.g. `EINVAL`) as well as
function headers (e.g. `malloc`).

This crate exports all underlying platform types, functions, and constants under
the crate root, so all items are accessible as `libc::foo`. The types and values
of all the exported APIs match the platform that libc is compiled for.

Windows API bindings are not included in this crate. If you are looking for
WinAPI bindings, consider using crates like [windows-sys].

More detailed information about the design of this library can be found in its
[associated RFC][rfc].

## v1.0 Roadmap

Currently, `libc` has two active branches: `main` for the upcoming v1.0 release,
and `libc-0.2` for the currently published version. By default all pull requests
should target `main`; once reviewed, they can be cherry picked to the `libc-0.2`
branch if needed.

We will stop making new v0.2 releases once v1.0 is released.

See the section in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#v10-roadmap) for more
details.

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
libc = "0.2"
```

## Features

* `std`: by default `libc` links to the standard library. Disable this feature
  to remove this dependency and be able to use `libc` in `#![no_std]` crates.

* `extra_traits`: all `struct`s implemented in `libc` are `Copy` and `Clone`.
  This feature derives `Debug`, `Eq`, `Hash`, and `PartialEq`.

The following features are deprecated:

* `use_std`: this is equivalent to `std`
* `const-extern-fn`: this is now enabled by default
* `align`: this is now enabled by default

## Rust version support

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently **Rust 1.63**.

Increases to the MSRV are allowed to change without a major (i.e. semver-
breaking) release in order to avoid a ripple effect in the ecosystem. A policy
for when this may change is a work in progress.

`libc` may continue to compile with Rust versions older than the current MSRV
but this is not guaranteed.

## Platform support

You can see the platform(target)-specific docs on [docs.rs], select a platform
you want to see.

See [`ci/verify-build.py`](https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/HEAD/ci/verify-build.py) for
the platforms on which `libc` is guaranteed to build for each Rust toolchain.
The test-matrix at [GitHub Actions] and [Cirrus CI] show the platforms in which
`libc` tests are run.
