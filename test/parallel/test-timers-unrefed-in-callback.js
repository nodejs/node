// Test1 checks that clearInterval works as expected for a timer
// unrefed within its callback: it removes the timer and its callback
// is not called anymore. Note that the only reason why this test is
// robust is that:
// 1. the repeated timer it creates has a delay of 1ms
// 2. when this test is completed, another test starts that creates a
//    new repeated timer with the same delay (1ms)
// 3. because of the way timers are implemented in libuv, if two
//    repeated timers A and B are created in that order with the same
//    delay, it is guaranteed that the first occurrence of timer A
//    will fire before the first occurrence of timer B
// 4. as a result, when the timer created by Test2 fired 11 times, if
//    the timer created by Test1 hadn't been removed by clearInterval,
//    it would have fired 11 more times, and the assertion in the
//    process'exit event handler would fail.
