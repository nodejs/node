<p>Test that a reused resource only appears in the buffer once.</p>

// Need our own image loading helper because the one in resource-loaders.js
// is designed to always side-step the HTTP cache but this test relies on the
// second request being resolved from the cache.

  const img = document.createElement('img');
  img.onload = img.onerror = () => resolve();
  img.src = path;

  // Second request. Should not appear in the timeline.
  await load_image(blue + "?cacheable");

  // Third request. When this request shows up in the timeline, we know that, if
  // the second request would generate an entry, that entry would have already
  // shown up in the timeline. Without this, we'd need to guess at how long to
  // wait which tends to be flaky.
