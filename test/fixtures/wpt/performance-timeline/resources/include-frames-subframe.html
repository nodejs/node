  This html is embedded as a sub-frame in include-frames-originA-B-A.html,
  include-frames-originA-B-B.html and include-frames-originA-A-A.html. Once embedded,
  this would take a url parameter named origin which is the origin of the child frame
  this html is to load in step 3 listed below.
  It does,
  1, waits for load.
  2, creates a single mark performance entry.
  3, creates and loads a child frame, and waits for it to load.
  4. posts a message to its parent with the combined number of performance entries
     in both this frame and the child (if readable).
