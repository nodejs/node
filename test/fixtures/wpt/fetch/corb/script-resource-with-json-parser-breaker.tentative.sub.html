<!-- Test verifies CORB will block responses beginning with a JSON parser
  breaker regardless of their MIME type (excluding text/css - see below).

  A JSON parser breaker is a prefix added to resources with sensitive data to
  prevent cross-site script inclusion (XSSI) and similar attacks.  For example,
  it may be included in JSON files to prevent them from leaking data via a
  <script> tag, making the response only useful to a fetch or XmlHttpRequest.
  See also https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/services/network/cross_origin_read_blocking_explainer.md#Protecting-JSON

  The assumption is that all images, other media, scripts, fonts and other
  resources that may be embedded cross-origin will never begin with a JSON
  parser breaker.  For example an JPEG image should always being with FF D8 FF,
  a PNG image with 89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A bytes and an SVG image with "<?xml"
  substring.

  The assumption above excludes text/css which (as shown by
  style-css-with-json-parser-breaker.sub.html) can parse as valid stylesheet
  even in presence of a JSON parser breaker.
