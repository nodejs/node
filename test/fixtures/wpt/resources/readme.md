## `testharness.js`

`testharness.js` is a framework for writing low-level tests of
browser functionality in javascript. It provides a convenient API for
making assertions and is intended to work for both simple synchronous
tests, and tests of asynchronous behaviour.

Complete documentation is available in the `docs/` directory of this repository
and on the web at https://web-platform-tests.org/writing-tests/.
